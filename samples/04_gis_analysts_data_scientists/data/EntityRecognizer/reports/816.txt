Two teenagers have now been arrested for a drug-related armed robbery that took place on May 26th in the 6700 block of Schroeder Rd. A 29-year-old Madison woman had planned to purchase a small amount of marijuana that morning from the suspects, but one pulled out a gun and the young men robbed the victim of her money and jewelry. MPD officers were able to identify the suspects after viewing surveillance video from a nearby store which showed the woman and teens together. A 14-year-old suspect was arrested at his home this past Wednesday. A 17-year-old suspect was apprehended yesterday afternoon following a lengthy foot chase in the Regent Street neighborhood.  Released 06/07/2019 at 1:47 PM by PIO Joel Despain
