 The MPD arrested one of three suspects following a mugging on Kanazawa Circle Monday night. A 19-year-old Cottage Grove man was walking with a friend when he was attacked. The victim said he was placed in a bear hug and thrown to the ground. He was then punched and kicked multiple times while one robber ran his pockets. The three young men fled on foot while the victim sought help from neighbors following the assault. He suffered numerous bruises and abrasions. Officers located one suspect in the area and took him into custody. Released 07/11/2017 at 9:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
