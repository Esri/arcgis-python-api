When a Mercedes was stolen New Year's Eve, MPD officers quickly went to the 7300 block of Tree Lane. They did so because several recent stolen autos were found to have been ditched in the area. Investigative instincts proved to be sound as the Mercedes was found parked on nearby Oakbridge Court. Several teens were near the car and took off running. Officers were able to chase down a couple of them, including one believed to be responsible for stealing the car. It had been left unlocked and running in front of Target, 201 Junction Rd. Its owner, had just made a purchase of a large item and had gotten help from an employee to loading it into her car. She then went back into the store for a moment and that is when the theft occurred. Surveillance video shows the suspect getting into the car and driving off. He was arrested for operating a motor vehicle without owner's consent and resisting. Released 01/02/2019 at 11:13 AM by PIO Joel Despain
