PHOTO ADDED Some elite Madison crime fighters caught burglars in action. . . and then released them!!!  While on routine patrol seasoned cops were checking the outer perimeter of city-owned property (formally known as Griffs restaurant across from Elver Park) to ensure all the doors were locked.  As they tactically approached the front doors, to their surprise they stumbled across a burglary in progress.  Yes the bandit raccoons, Regina, Ricky, Remmington and Roger were caught in middle of the crime.  Their crime??  They entered a small hole in the roof, scurried around and fell.  Their fall landed in a make-shift jail between the two glass doors of the entry-way.  They were stuck!!  Sergeant Chuck Weiss, a seasoned 30-year veteran determined this was the first time he was going to actually catch these burglars in action and release them as soon as possible; but how??? No one has keys laying around at 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday night.  The hinges were taken off the door and the cute little raccoons were set free.  Free to find food and water.  "My biggest concern was for the raccoons to be stuck in there until Monday without food and water, so our thoughts were to rescue the raccoons as quickly and safely as possible", noted Sergeant Weiss.  Released 06/18/2017 at 6:18 AM by Lt.
