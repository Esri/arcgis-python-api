Several citizens held a robbery and battery suspect on the ground until police arrived Sunday night. He had pushed a Williamson St. resident as the victim was unloading his car outside of his home. The suspect reached in and stole a bag containing inexpensive personal possessions and took off. A witness was punched in the head, and knocked onto a lawn, as he attempted to intervene. Both victims gave chase as the suspect fled into a nearby business. He emerged a short time later, and was detained by the citizen posse. The battery victim displayed concussion-like symptoms, but was not seriously injured. It was not clear what motivated the crimes, although those who observed the suspect said he was acting in an odd way. Released 07/05/2016 at 10:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
