 Last night, two masked men, both of whom were armed with handguns, robbed the Subway restaurant located at 4692 Cottage Grove Rd. When police arrived, they found two employees highly traumatized. One woman was hysterical and crying during her entire contact with an officer. The officer did her best tried her best to console the sandwich maker. The victim said she told gunmen "don't shoot us," as she and her colleague followed directions to turn over the restaurant's money. Released 08/21/2018 at 9:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
