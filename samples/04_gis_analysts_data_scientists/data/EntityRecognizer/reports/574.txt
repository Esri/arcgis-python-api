On 12/27/2015, shortly after 6:42pm, officers were dispatched to the 200 block of W. Gilman St., reference an attack that was ongoing, and information was conveyed that a firearm might be involved.  Officers converged on the area, and immediately noticed three male subjects, near the 400 block of N. Henry Street, start to run.  Officers gave chase, and managed to catch up to one subject, later identified as Keanu Vree.  As they attempted to find out where the second subject had fled to, Vree acted as if he didn't know what the officers were asking.  The second subject, later identified as Cameron Braun-Londre, was thought to have run into an alleyway, and was possibly hiding inside of a garbage can.  Officers located Braun-Londre near the 200 block of W. Gilman, and attempted to detain him, but that was met with immediate resistance. The officers were concerned, as the male described as having a weapon during the altercation, fit the exact description of Braun-Londre. Braun-Londre jumped from the garbage can, and quickly approached the officer.  He refused to comply with the officer directing him to the ground, and continued to tell the officer what he was not going to do.  He then started taking his sweatshirt off, and the officer seized the opportunity to place him in handcuffs; as the sweatshirt got stuck on Braun-Londre's head. As the investigation drew to a close, it was determined that Braun-Londre, Vree, and possibly two other unidentified males had approached the victims, and were looking to start a fight.  The victims were surrounded by Braun-Londre, Vree, and company, but calmer heads prevailed by the victim's calling police for assistance; especially since the implication of a firearm was uttered by Braun-Londre.  There were no injuries sustained in this scenario, but alcohol may have been a contributing factor.    PO Howard Payne Released 12/31/2015 at 9:50 AM by P.O.
