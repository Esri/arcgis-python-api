A suspected drug dealer attempted to destroy 50 grams of fentanyl laced heroin Monday by throwing it into the air. Stanley Miles, age 44, Madison, did so as the Town of Madison Police Department and members of the Dane County Narcotics Task Force (DCNTF) served a search warrant on a Sherman Ave. apartment, located in the Town of Madison. Three officers were treated and released for exposure to the powerful synthetic opioid. The Madison Fire Department's Hazardous Incident Team worked with state and federal partners to safely search the apartment wearing protective gear. It was determined there was no general danger to the public because of the incident. Miles, and another resident (see above) were taken into custody. Between 50 and 100 grams of heroin - including what Miles tried to destroy - were seized. Agents also confiscated more than 37 grams of crack cocaine, 109 grams of THC, cell phones, a handgun, and over $1,400 cash. The arrests are part of an ongoing DCNTF investigation.    Released 12/04/2018 at 11:45 AM by PIO Joel Despain
