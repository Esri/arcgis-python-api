The MPD responded quickly to an alarm coming from the CVS Pharmacy, 2 S. Bedford St., early this morning. An officer – who had not been far away from the call - located a suspect in a rear parking lot. Door glass had been shattered in two spots, but entry had not been made. The suspect was found to have a hammer, a screwdriver, and a flashlight in his pockets. He was carrying an empty messenger bag, and had fresh cuts or scratches on his right hand. He said he was out for a walk and had nothing to do with the attempted break-in. Officers arrested him on tentative charges listed above. Released 04/13/2016 at 9:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
