A downtown resident found a burglar inside his W. Washington Ave. home Friday afternoon. The suspect was trying to steal a laptop computer that belonged to the resident's roommate, but put it down upon being confronted by the 21-year-old. The victim was able to provide police with a good description and the suspect was located, still in the area. He had another laptop computer in a backpack that he claimed had been given to him. The investigation revealed the 54-year-old had been checking doors in the neighborhood and entering residences that had been left unlocked. He was arrested for burglary. Officers are trying to identify the rightful owner of the seized laptop. Released 05/16/2016 at 9:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
