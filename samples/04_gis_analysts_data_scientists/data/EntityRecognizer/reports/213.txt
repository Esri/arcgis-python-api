An entrepreneur, who makes money selling apparel and shoes out of his van, was held up Sunday while conducting business in a S. Gammon Rd. parking lot. Several young men were trying on garments and shoes. One "customer" announced, "I'm not paying s-!" as he pulled out a handgun. He and his friends drove off in a white SUV, still wearing the victim's merchandise, including a pair of trousers valued at $250. Released 06/20/2016 at 11:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
