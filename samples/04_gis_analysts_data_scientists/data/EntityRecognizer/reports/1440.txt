 A 23-year-old man, competing in a recreational soccer game Sunday night, suffered facial and nasal fractures after being attacked by several players from the opposing team. The battery took place at the Salon Centinela Soccer Club, 5018 Blazing Star Dr. A teammate of the victim said a melee broke out when someone from the other team - which was losing with a couple of minutes to play - committed a hard foul. The victim had not noticed the initial skirmish, and was playing on when he was punched in the head from behind. This put him down, and once on the field three to four members of the opposing team began kicking him in the head. The suspects fled prior to police arrival, and the MPD is in the process of trying to identify them. Released 09/25/2017 at 11:14 AM by PIO Joel Despain
