A Milwaukee Street homeowner contacted the MPD last night after discovering two handguns missing following a burglary. A responding officer determined an intruder entered through a bedroom window after cutting a screen. Nothing else was stolen. The victim believed the break-in likely occurred around 9:00 p.m. That's when he heard a loud noise while watching TV. He didn't realize someone had actually gotten into his house until he found the bedroom window open a couple of hours later.    Released 03/06/2019 at 11:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
