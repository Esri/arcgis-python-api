A frightened Lumley Rd. resident grabbed her two dogs and fled her home last night after a stranger entered through an unlocked backdoor. The victim did not see the person, but heard them go into the bathroom. The victim locked herself, and her two dogs, in her car and called police. Officers set up a perimeter and brought in a K9. The intruder initially failed to comply with commands or attempts at dialogue, but was ultimately takenp1  into custody for trespassing. She was intoxicated and had no explanation as to why she entered the home. "It's neither here nor there," she said. The MPD continues to urge everyone to keep doors locked, even when you are at home.   Released 01/23/2018 at 10:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
