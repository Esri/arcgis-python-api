 Early this morning, the MPD responded to multiple intrusion alarms coming from Lakeview Elementary School, 1802 Tennyson Lane. Officers spotted a teenager and three younger children inside the school. They indicated they had entered through a window, and did not take anything. However, the young people indicated they had also broken into the school the night prior and stolen electronics, including two iPads. Some also implicated themselves in a break-in to the Madison Mallards Baseball stadium, 2920 N. Sherman Ave. That burglary also took place Monday night. The arrested teen said they took a few cans of soda pop from the stadium. Items stolen from the school were located and returned. Released 06/22/2016 at 10:45 AM by PIO Joel Despain
