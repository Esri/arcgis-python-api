 Witnesses saw and heard a man and woman arguing at the corner of E. Dayton St. and N. Paterson St. early Sunday morning. One – it is not known if it was the man or the woman - pulled out a gun and fired two shots. Responding officers found a couple of shell casings but could not locate the feuding couple. There were no reports of injuries or property damage. Released 04/23/2018 at 10:47 AM by PIO Joel Despain
