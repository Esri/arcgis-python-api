Westbound Regent St traffic may experience delays between Monroe St and Breese Ter until 12:00pm (noon) today to clean up from traffic incident below. At approximately 02:00am, a vehicle was observed heading westbound on Regent St crossing Park St at a high rate of speed. That vehicle struck a hydrant on Regent St near Breese Ter then continued westbound striking a light pole. The car separated from its axles, engine, and transmission and slid a city block to Lathrop St where it was stopped by a tree. The two occupants were assisted out by witnesses and fled west on foot along the bike path as the vehicle became engulfed in flames. Released 10/20/2017 at 5:13 AM by Sgt. Daryl Doberstein
