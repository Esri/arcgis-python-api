It was MPD K9 Boris who led officers to a loaded handgun and bag of cocaine Tuesday afternoon after a suspect ran as police responded to a disturbance complaint on Silver Rd. Citizens had reported a loud argument taking place outside of a SUV, which had just pulled into a dead-end. The suspect was seen flashing a wad of cash. When the MPD arrived, he took off running. Officers caught him and then had Boris retrace his flight path. Boris did a good job.
