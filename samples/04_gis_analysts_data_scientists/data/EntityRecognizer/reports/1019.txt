 A high school student said a strange man pulled his car up next to her and asked if she wanted a ride while she was walking on S. Westfield Rd. shortly before 4:00 p.m. Wednesday. The teen told him no, and said the man then drove slowly next to her as she continued to walk. She says the man then made several u-turns, driving his car past each time while staring. She did not initially contact police, but was advised to call 911 immediately if this happens again. Released 02/26/2016 at 3:36 PM by PIO Joel Despain
