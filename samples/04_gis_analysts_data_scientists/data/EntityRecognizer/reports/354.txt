 An officer was called to a local hospital yesterday to meet with a battery victim who had suffered several broken bones. The 61-year-old man says he was walking in the 1100 block of Williamson St. Saturday night when a stranger asked him for a couple of dollars. The victim said he had no spare change. He says that's when the other man punched him in the head and pushed him to the ground. The victim blacked out, and when he regained consciousness realized the few dollars he had in his pocket were now gone. He walked to a friend's house to seek help, but did not contact the MPD.
