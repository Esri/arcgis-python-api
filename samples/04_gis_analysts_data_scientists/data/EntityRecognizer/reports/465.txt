 The MPD received a report regarding a missing child this morning. Dominique Hale, age 11, needs to be on his medication or could become very ill. Dominique lives on Wright St. He is 4'5" and 90 pounds. He was last seen wearing a dark winter jacket and tennis shoes. If anyone sees Dominique, or knows of his whereabouts, they are asked to contact 911. There is no evidence that Dominique is the victim of foul play, but again, there is concern for his welfare because of a medical condition. Released 01/16/2019 at 3:51 PM by PIO Joel Despain
