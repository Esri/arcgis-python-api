Thursday afternoon, there was information coming from dispatch regarding a blue Jeep. It was said to be traveling south on Fair Oaks Ave. and had just struck a couple of cars while going around 80 mph. A MPD officer was in the area and spotted the SUV. It had severe front-end damage. There were parts hanging beneath it, nearly touching the ground, and the Jeep was smoking. The officer saw the driver run a red light on E. Washington Ave. near a populated shopping mall. He got behind it and tried to pull the driver over. The suspect did not stop, but pulled through a parking lot and onto Hermina St. where he eventually got out of the Jeep and began to walk away. The officer was ordering the man to stop. The man was yelling for the police officer to shoot him. The suspect was taken to the ground, and the officer - with help from a passerby – was able to get him in handcuffs.  The driver is facing a number of tentative charges. They are listed above.  Released 05/24/2019 at 11:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
