  A 13-year-old girl became scared last night after a stranger began hanging out on the porch of her Northport Dr. townhouse. The teen was home alone, and decided to walk to a nearby friend's apartment so she could be with someone. The man followed, asking the girl about her name and commenting on the clothing she was wearing. When an officer arrived, many children approached saying the same man had made similar uncomfortable statements to them. The officer located the man, who initially gave a fake name. He was arrested on a number of warrants and on tentative charges which are listed above. He denied having any conversations with children.  Released 06/06/2019 at 11:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
