A McDonald's employee suffered a knee injury after being pushed down during a strong-armed robbery Monday night. The 63-year-old victim said a man – who had his face covered with a white scarf - came in and placed an order at the Odana Rd. restaurant. He then jumped the counter, knocked her down, and grabbed money from the till. He got into a car and fled.  Released 01/19/2016 at 9:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
