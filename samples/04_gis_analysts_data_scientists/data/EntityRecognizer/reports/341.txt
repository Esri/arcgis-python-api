Officers were dispatched to the above address originally for a business alarm. Once officers arrived on scene, it was evident that forced entry was made into the business. It appears that multiple individual packs and multiple cartons of cigarettes were stolen. The suspect is still at large. Released 01/29/2019 at 1:50 AM by Sgt. Ryan Gibson
