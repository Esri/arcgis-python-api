 A downtown employee had just used her access card to key the outside door of her E. Mifflin St. workplace Saturday morning when a stranger pushed his way into the vestibule with her. He grabbed for the victim's purse. She struggled to keep control and in the process dropped her Starbucks, her jacket, and her water bottle. The robber was able to rip the purse away and run. The victim, who was very distraught, chased after him while yelling for help. A witness saw what was happening and ordered the suspect to drop the purse, which he did, causing its contents to spill all over the sidewalk. The victim and witness provided the MPD with a good description and the suspect was located and arrested not long after the crime took place. Released 01/23/2017 at 9:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
