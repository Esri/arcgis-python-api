 Motorists on the West Beltline Highway were in the process of calling in a van that was all over the roadway Monday afternoon, when it got off on S. Gammon Rd. and crashed into vehicles stopped for a red light at Watts Rd. There were no serious injuries. The van's driver blamed the collision on bad brakes, but a MPD investigation suggested otherwise and she was arrested on tentative charges listed above.
