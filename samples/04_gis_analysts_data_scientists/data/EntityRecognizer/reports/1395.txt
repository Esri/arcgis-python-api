MPD detectives say it is quite possible a July bank robber was thinking about holding up the same financial institution again this past weekend, but got spooked and ran before committing another crime. The description of the robber and the suspicious person from this weekend are very similar (see above). On July 14th, Chase Bank, 602 N. High Point Rd., the robber approached a teller, showed he had a handgun in his waistband, and demanded money. This past Saturday, at around 9:45 a.m., a man walked in the lobby, where employees were present. Like the July heist, he was wearing, sunglasses, a bandana, and had a dark hood over his head. Employees felt for sure another robbery was about to take place, but instead the man fled. Anyone with information is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.     Released 08/23/2016 at 10:41 AM by PIO Joel Despain
