An intoxicated man who armed himself with a look-like-gun was safely taken into custody after the MPD was called to a domestic disturbance on National Ave. yesterday. The first responding officer saw the weapon in the man's hand as he stood near the front door. She retreated away from the home to take cover behind a squad car. A backup officer was on the scene seconds later and gave the man verbal commands. At this point, he was seated on porch steps with the gun next to his feet. He initially ignored officers' commands, pawing his hands along the ground as if he might pick the firearm back up. He eventually did stand up, and as he did, the officers - approaching from opposite sides - were able to grab the weapon. It turned out to be a BB gun. The despondent man was taken to a hospital as officers told him he had really placed his life in potential jeopardy by coming outside - as police were arriving - with what looked a real gun.  Released 02/04/2016 at 12:20 PM by PIO Joel Despain
