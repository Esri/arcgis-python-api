 A private security guard for Hilldale Mall feared she might be shot Friday evening after a retail theft suspect broke her phone - as she called 911 - and reached into his jacket making it look like he had a weapon. He fled on foot up N. Eau Claire Ave. toward Rennebohm Park with the victim following at a safe distance behind. The MPD arrived and the security guard called out: "Help me. He's got a gun. He's going to shoot me." The suspect was found hiding in some bushes. Officers could not find a gun and the man was arrested on numerous tentative charges. The victim said the suspect is known to mall retailers as someone who has stolen merchandise in the past. He had in his possession a black suede jacket with an anti-theft tag still attached at the time of his apprehension. Released 03/19/2018 at 9:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
