 A Sawmill Rd. homeowner likely scared off would-be burglars early this morning. He saw three young men – all of whom appeared to be in their late teens - creeping through his backyard. One illuminated a flashlight into his family room window. At that point, the resident yelled out a window and the trio took off running towards Wexford Park.
