On 6/24/2016, shortly after 2:05am, Madison Police responded to the 600 block of University Avenue reference a 21-year-old male bleeding and in need of medical attention.  Initially, the male subject seemed to have sustained a head injury, both due to a fall and with no other individuals around him to advise police as to what had occurred.  Upon further review, the injuries seemed to not be consistent with a fall, and may have been the result of a battery.  The Madison Fire Department was summoned to transport this subject to a local hospital for his injuries, and the last update provided to MPD was that his injuries were non-life threatening.  The Madison Police Department continues to investigate this matter, but does ask anyone with information to contact authorities as soon as possible.    PO Howard Payne  Released 06/27/2016 at 11:18 AM by P.O.
