After having left the bar, Gorski and Lanier would return a short time later, and had to be asked to leave again; as they were being boisterous with staff members who quickly ushered them off the property.  Just before leaving, Lanier allegedly made a comment about having a gun, and that stood out as alarming to both the concerned witness and staff member.  Gorski and Lanier finally left the bar, and were seen walking on University Avenue; presumably drinking alcohol from a brown bag. Shortly after 2:00 am, officers received information that two male subjects were near a residence, close to W. Dayton and Broom Street, and were believed to be armed; based on yet another disturbance call.  Officers staged and while taking the gun information seriously, contacted Gorski and Lanier.  Gorski became immediately combative, attempted to flee, and was immediately taken into custody.  Lanier was also placed under arrest, and officers did find baggies of Cocaine.  No gun was located, but Gorski did have a knife in his possession.  The photograph that was submitted to the officer, two hours earlier, proved to solidify the identity of both suspects, and led to their arrest.    PO Howard Payne  Released 08/16/2017 at 4:19 PM by P.O.
