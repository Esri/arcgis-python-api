Anyone who has been victimized by a burglar knows that feeling of violation, of no longer feeling as safe as you once did in your own home. A recent west side break-in had an even greater personal impact on a 40-year-old resident. The criminal appears to have entered through an unlocked door; stolen a gun, ammunition and money, but the burglar did not stop there. Likely, not knowing what was in a container – one that is sacred and special beyond words to the victim – he or she dumped its contents onto a pan on the kitchen stove. Those contents are worth more than anything the burglar would steal. They are the cremation remains of the victim's father. The MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit is on the case.
