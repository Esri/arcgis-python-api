 Several West District officers were dispatched to the 2300 block of Allied Dr. late yesterday afternoon after concerned callers reported seeing men being loud and waving a gun around behind an apartment building. Several indicated the weapon had been fired. Officers used a tactical response, meaning their weapons were drawn. They quickly discerned two 20-year-old men had been shooting at a target with a very real-looking BB gun. The men were counseled on how dangerous of a situation they created for officers and were given citations for discharge of weapon violations. Released 09/22/2017 at 10:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
