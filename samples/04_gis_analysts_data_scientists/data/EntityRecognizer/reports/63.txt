Their value is more than dollars and cents, as the two bicycles were built by hand. A Manchester Rd. resident reported the two-wheelers were stolen from the family's garage Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. The custom bikes are valued at $4,500. Anyone with information on where they might be is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 05/19/2016 at 1:49 PM by PIO Joel Despain
