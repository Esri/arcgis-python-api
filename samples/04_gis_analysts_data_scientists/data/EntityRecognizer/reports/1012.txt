 A 13-year-old boy, who pointed a handgun at a couple of older teens, was arrested in the 1500 block of Troy last night for disorderly conduct while armed. The weapon, which looked real, turned out to be a pellet gun. The young man was counseled by officers about the dangerousness of his actions, and how carrying a BB or pellet gun could result in someone being seriously hurt or killed.
