The customer was at the drive-thru, and had gotten his food, after handing a fast food employee a $100 bill last night. The man was told he would need to come in the restaurant to get his change.  A Burger King manager made the call to buy time as police were being summoned.  The bill the man passed was not even close: it did not feel right, Ben Franklin's face was a bit distorted, and it was clearly marked "FOR MOTION PICTURE USE ONLY." The suspect was still in line at the W. Badger Rd. restaurant when a MPD officer arrived to make an arrest for forgery.  Released 11/02/2016 at 11:31 AM by PIO Joel Despain
