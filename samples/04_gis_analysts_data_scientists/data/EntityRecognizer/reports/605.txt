A 31-year-old man was taking his dog for a walk near the Brittingham Park Shelter, 401 West Shore Drive, Saturday morning when he observed the suspect shouting at a 69-year-old man, who was visiting from Iron River, Michigan,  and the man's female companion, a 66-year-old Madison resident. The citizen then observed the suspect suddenly kick the 69-year-old male in the face while the victim was sitting on a blanket. The Good Samaritan quickly handed his dog leash to the victim's female companion before tackling the suspect to the ground. The citizen received minor injuries as he restrained the suspect until police arrived on scene and took him into custody. Further investigation revealed that the suspect - who had been drinking -  had no relationship to the victims, and had accused them of calling the police on him before initiating the attack. Ultimately, the suspect was booked into the Dane County Jail on tentative charges of aggravated battery against an elderly person, battery, and disorderly conduct.
