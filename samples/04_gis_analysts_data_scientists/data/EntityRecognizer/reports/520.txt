 A Madison woman was trying to sell her car on Craigslist for $700, and through some text message exchanges thought she had found an out-of-state buyer. He sent the 21-year-old a $2,200 check. It was to cover the vehicle purchase plus costs associated with hiring a driver to get the car from point A to point B: Madison to wherever the "buyer" was located. The woman was told to send $1,450, via a Walmart money transfer, to the transport guy who – as the story goes – was in Cleveland. The car seller did just that, only to find out that the purchaser's check was a fake. However, the funds she sent were very real. They were from her account, and they were gone. She had been double-crossed, swindled and hoodwinked. Released 05/26/2017 at 11:24 AM by PIO Joel Despain
