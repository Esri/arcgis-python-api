 Multiple officers quickly responded to an apartment in the 4900 block of Mineral Point Rd. last night after a resident claimed to have been shot. As first responders arrived, many concerned neighbors told them they knew of no gunfire or anyone being hurt. Police made contact with the man who had called 911 and he proceeded to fight with officers, with one MPD sergeant suffering a blow to the head that caused a sizable lump. The man was arrested on multiple tentative charges including dialing 911 for a false emergency. Released 04/17/2019 at 11:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
