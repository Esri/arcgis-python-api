 Shocked diners and staff members, inside a popular downtown restaurant last night, did not know what to think when a woman entered and yelled out that there was a bomb about to explode. The suspect began counting down from 10, and ordered people to "get on the ground, on your hands and knees." She loudly announced:" It's going to blow up!" The manager told the woman to leave, but she refused and police were called. The suspect struggled with officers and was taken to jail. There were about 25 guests and employees at Red Sushi, 316 W. Washington Ave., when the disturbance took place. Released 09/15/2016 at 11:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
