 A 10-year-old girl reported a stranger speaking to her while she was walking her dog on Elizabeth St. yesterday afternoon. He made her feel uncomfortable, and she learned in school to tell a trusted adult about such an encounter. She said the man was in a car and asked her things like what grade she was in and what school she attends. She ignored him, went home and told a parent about what occurred.
