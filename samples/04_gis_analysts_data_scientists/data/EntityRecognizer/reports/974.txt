A new tool being provided to MPD patrol officers, and other county law enforcement, this year paid off again yesterday as a stolen 2013 Subaru Crosstrek was recovered on Adderbury Circle. A suspect who had just gotten out of the driver's seat, and tried to walk away, was taken into custody. The arresting officer was keenly aware of the car's stolen status as it was one listed on the MPD's "Hot Sheet." Officers in the department's Criminal Intelligence Section began putting out electronic bulletins, complete with photos of stolen vehicles, this year in an attempt to get stolen cars back to their owners faster. The Subaru had been taken from the driveway of a Hooker Ave. home a week ago. It was listed on the most recent "Hot Sheet," and a West District patrol officer recognized it as such and began following it on Raymond Rd., just prior to yesterday's arrest. CIS officers indicate many stolen vehicles are left unlocked with keys inside, and say a number of these crimes of opportunity would be reduced if people kept doors locked, and kept keys inside their homes.
