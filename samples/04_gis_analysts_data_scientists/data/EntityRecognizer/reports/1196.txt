 The MPD was called to a hospital last night around 9:45 p.m. after a battery victim arrived with facial injuries. The 23-year-old says he was attacked by three men sometime between 4:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. while he was in the parking lot of Pizza Pit Extreme, 1614 Monroe St. The victim said one asked him for bus money, and that he was assaulted following the request. There were no independent reports of a disturbance, or a battery, during the timeframe provided by the victim. Officers were unable to locate a crime scene and a detective could not find surveillance video that showed a crime taking place. The victim said he did not initially wish contact with police but did so at the urging of family. He did suffer significant facial injuries, and how he was hurt continues to be investigated. Anyone with information is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 02/21/2017 at 11:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
