 A drunken man pulled a folding knife on police officers - but did not extend its blade - as he threatened to cut them. He also told a female officer he would slit her throat. The MPD had contacted the man inside Walgreens, 2909 E. Washington Ave., where he was creating a disturbance by yelling at staff and customers yesterday afternoon. The knife incident took place outside as officers tried to calm the man down. They were able to safely disarm him and take him into custody. Released 02/20/2018 at 9:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
