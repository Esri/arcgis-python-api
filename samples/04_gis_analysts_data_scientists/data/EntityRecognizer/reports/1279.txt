Boyfriend and girlfriend stated they were contacted by an acquaintance who asked if they could drive to the West side of Madison to pick up a friend.  They do so, bringing him to the 1100 block of Moorland Rd.  The boyfriend stated he exited the vehicle, at which point the suspect pulled a gun on the girlfriend and demanded money.  Having seen police in the area when she pulled in, she honked the horn repeatedly, at which point the suspect fled with only the cell phone of the girlfriend.  Investigation is continuing.
