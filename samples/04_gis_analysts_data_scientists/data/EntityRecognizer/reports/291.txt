On June 24, 2018 at 2:37 am MPD officers were dispatched to Plan B nightclub in the 900 block of Williamson Street regarding a damage to property complaint. A large plate glass window at the front of the venue had been shattered. A brick or block apparently had been used to smash the window. A potential suspect in the incident is a taller black male with a baseball cap worn backwards. MPD is hoping video surveillance will help identify the suspect.  Anyone with information is urged to call 255-2345. As a reminder, crimes that are committed targeting a victim because of the perpetrator's "belief or perception regarding the race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry of" the victim may include enhanced penalties. Evidence of motivation is required for successful prosecution of such cases. Those wishing more information on "hate crimes" may see Wisconsin statutes 939.645. https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/IV/645  Released 06/25/2018 at 1:40 PM by P.O.
