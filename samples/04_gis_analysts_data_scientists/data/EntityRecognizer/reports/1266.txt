 A responding officer said the victim of a fourth degree sexual assault was so upset that she felt sick to her stomach. She cried as she recounted what had just happened Tuesday afternoon inside Half Price Books, 626 S. Whitney Way. The 50-year-old was reaching up to a higher shelf when someone began groping her from behind. She yelled out to staff members and the man ran off. An employee went outside and was able to get the license plate of his car. He was later located at his home in Cross Plains by Cross Plains Police and arrested.
