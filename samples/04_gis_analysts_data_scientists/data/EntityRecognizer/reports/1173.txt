 A Madison couple believe they were shot at following a road rage incident on Northport Dr. Friday night. The 64-year-old driver said he "flipped off" those inside a small, dark-colored SUV after the SUV cut in front of him without signaling. He says the SUV soon pulled up alongside of him, and he could see the front passenger window was down. He and his passenger both heard what they thought was a gunshot. There was no damage to their vehicle and they were not injured. Released 12/03/2018 at 9:55 AM by PIO Joel Despain
