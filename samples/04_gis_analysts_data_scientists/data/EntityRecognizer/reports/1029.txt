 A Sun Prairie woman and her nine-year-old granddaughter were not injured following a Tuesday afternoon crash involving a drunken driver. The victims were inside a van and stopped for a red light on E. Washington Ave. when the van was rear ended by a pickup. The truck's driver drove off, but was pulled over by the MPD a short time later after witnesses provided police with a description and license plate number. The 64-year-old Madison driver was arrested for hit-and-run and fifth offense drunken driving. Released 05/17/2017 at 10:38 AM by PIO Joel Despain
