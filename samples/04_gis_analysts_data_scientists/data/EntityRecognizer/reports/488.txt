Their friends ran away, but they could not following a high-speed crash early Sunday morning that sent a stolen Jeep into a tree in the 2600 block of Coolidge St.When first responders arrived, they found a 15-year-old girl limping near the scene. A hundred yards away a 14-year-old boy went up to a firefighter saying he was also hurt and needed help. This is the teens second crash in the past month. They were also injured while traveling in a stolen SUV that slammed into a home on Dunns Marsh Terrace on November 17th. Both are well known to police for being part of a crew that has gained significant media and community attention by stealing cars.When asked about the crash, the 14-year-old boy claimed they had been in an Uber, which was - obviously - a lie. He and the girl will be facing tentative criminal charges, but for now remain hospitalized.  Released 12/17/2018 at 9:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
