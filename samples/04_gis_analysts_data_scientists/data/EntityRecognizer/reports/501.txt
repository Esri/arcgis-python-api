MPD Officers were stopped near the Alliant Energy Center with Town of Madison Officers on a traffic stop.  Mendez-Mino swerved over and nearly struck the squads.  Officers stopped the vehicle on Novation Parkway. Both Mendez-Mino and his passenger were non- compliant but were eventually taken into custody. Mendez-Mino admitted to officers that he was trying to crash into the squad car to "kill them." Mendez-Mino was taken to the PSB for 2nd Degree Recklessly endangering safety and Traffic Crime for failure to stop, along with other citations.  Town of Madison assisted MPD on the stop.
