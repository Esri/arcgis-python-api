A pizza delivery driver was delivering pizza to an address in the 4300 block of Britta Parkway. As he parked his vehicle, two black male subjects began walking towards him from the building. The two black males engaged in conversation with the delivery driver and attempted to pay for the pizza with fake money. Suspect #2 pulled a handgun out and pointed it at the delivery driver. The suspects took the pizza from the driver, and ran behind the building. No injuries. Officers canvassed the area. Suspects are still at-large. Released 05/02/2017 at 1:40 AM by Sgt. Eugene Woehrle
