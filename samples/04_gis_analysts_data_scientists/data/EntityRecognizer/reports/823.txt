 Vandals have caused several thousand dollars to an empty building, still owned by Epic, on Tokay Boulevard. A caretaker called for police and fire after a door and fire alarms went off Saturday afternoon. Some paper products were burned, and a fire extinguisher discharged, inside the building. A door was found to be damaged Saturday. Earlier in the week, several windows were broken. Two male juveniles on bicycles were seen peddling away from the area just after Saturday's alarms.
