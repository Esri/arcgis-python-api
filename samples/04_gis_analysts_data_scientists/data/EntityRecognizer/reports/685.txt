 Some Memorial High School students saw a man acting strangely inside a van that was parked in the school's parking lot this morning. They contacted staff members, and the school's Educational Resource Officer and another MPD officer contacted the man. The trespasser was in possession of two fake guns. He also had two outstanding Dane County warrants for disorderly conduct for which he was arrested. At no time did the man threaten any students or the school. It was not immediately known why he was on school grounds. Released 02/28/2018 at 3:34 PM by PIO Joel Despain
