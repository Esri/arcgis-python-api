A downtown officer was driving in the 600 block of State Street early this morning when a young man suddenly ran into the street, ripped off his shirt, and began flexing his muscles, appearing as if he was about to fight someone. Several bystanders rushed to the officer's squad to let him know the shirtless man had just punched a woman in the face. Seeing the officer, the suspect sprinted off, but was taken into custody following a foot chase through a nearby parking ramp. Back at the scene, the victim – who had a swollen lip – explained how she was punched, and how she believed her assailant would have battered her further had it not been for the arrival of the MPD officer. It was the first time anyone had ever struck her, and she was very thankful the MPD was nearby to prevent further violence. The woman said, prior to the battery, she had gotten into an argument with the man after he asked her for money and she refused to give him any cash. While she does not know him well, she said they did, at one time, work for the same employer.  Released 06/06/2019 at 10:24 AM by PIO Joel Despain
