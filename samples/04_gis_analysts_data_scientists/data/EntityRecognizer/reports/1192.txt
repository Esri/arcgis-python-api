A Madison mother, with two young children in her car, was left badly shaken after another motorist displayed a handgun following road rage incident on the West Beltline Highway yesterday afternoon. The woman said the other driver cut her off in traffic, and then pulled alongside of her. He appeared to be yelling something, although she was unable to decipher his words. As she was about to pull off on S. Park St., he lifted up the weapon. She immediately called 911. The gunman was not located. Released 12/14/2016 at 10:25 AM by PIO Joel Despain
