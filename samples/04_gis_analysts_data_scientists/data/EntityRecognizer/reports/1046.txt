 A Chicago man was knocked out after being "sucker punched" in the 600 block of University Ave. Saturday evening. The victim had confronted a stranger who had just aggressively grabbed the buttocks of the victim's friend, a 20-year-old Madison woman. The male victim was letting the man know just how wrong his unwanted sexual contact had been. The man responded by throwing a right hook that sent the victim to the ground. His head bounced off concrete as he landed. He went to a hospital with facial injuries to include damaged teeth. The female victim was in tears as she told a responding officer about the crimes. If a suspect can be identified, he will be arrested for fourth degree sexual assault and substantial battery.  Released 04/30/2018 at 11:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
