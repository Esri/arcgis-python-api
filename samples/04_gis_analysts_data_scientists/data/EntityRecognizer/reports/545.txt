A robber made off with the entire cash register during a Wednesday afternoon holdup at Subway, 1814 W. Beltline Highway. An employee said the criminal kept a hand in a pocket, trying to make it appear he had a gun, while demanding money from the till. The victim told the crook he did not have a key to open the register, and that is when the robber made the decision to grab it and run. Released 04/06/2017 at 9:26 AM by PIO Joel Despain
