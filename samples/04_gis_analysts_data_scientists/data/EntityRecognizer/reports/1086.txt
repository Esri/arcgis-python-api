 A man who had just watched the Journey concert at the Alliant Energy Center last night suffered a broken leg after being struck by a car while crossing E. Olin Ave. after the show. There were many pedestrians and vehicles in the congested area and the victim had cut between stopped eastbound traffic into the westbound lanes. That is when he was hit by a car. There were no citations issued. Released 03/29/2017 at 9:14 AM by PIO Joel Despain
