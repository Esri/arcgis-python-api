 There have been a couple of recent phone scams  targeting Spanish-speaking Madison men, both of whom ended up wiring money to addresses in the Dominican Republic following contacts that began on Facebook. In the latest case, a 35-year-old Allied Dr. resident accepted friend requests from women he did not know. The victim was later contacted by a man who claimed he now owed money for his correspondence with the women. He was told he and his family would be killed if he did not pay. The victim ended up wiring $300 to the Dominican Republic. In a similar case, a 38-year-old Rosenberry resident wired $500 to the Dominican Republic earlier this month. He had clicked on a Facebook ad for a massage, and was later contacted by someone threatening to kill him if he did not send money. Both victims said they were also sent images of men holding guns. They ultimately contacted the MPD and a Spanish-speaking officer assured they were not in real danger, but were victims of fraud. Released 02/02/2017 at 10:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
