 A 21-year-old man was taken to a hospital with a broken nose and a concussion after being attacked by a knife-wielding man Saturday night. The victim, and another man, both of whom are homeless, accepted an offer to stay in the suspect's West Washington Ave. apartment, in order to stay warm. While at the residence, all were drinking beer. At some point, the suspect became enraged, grabbing a kitchen knife and threatening to kill the victim. He proceeded to repeatedly punch and strangle the younger man to the point of unconsciousness. The injured man, and the other guest were able to escape a short time later. They began banging on doors of neighboring apartments hoping someone would summon help. They were successful. The MPD was called. Officers assisted the victim in getting to a hospital, and arrested the suspect. Released 02/18/2019 at 9:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
