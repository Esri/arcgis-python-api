A burglar cut a window screen and entered a second floor State St. apartment early this morning. A resident was inside and yelled at the burglar who fled back out the window empty-handed. The window looks out onto a flat roof which the criminal had accessed. Released 04/15/2016 at 12:27 PM by PIO Joel Despain
