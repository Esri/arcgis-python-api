 UW-Madison Police officers assisted the MPD in taking a robbery suspect into custody early Sunday morning after a college student had her cell phone, credit card and ID card taken. The victim was walking with friends along N. Park St. when the suspect came up from behind and snatched the cell phone - containing the other stolen items - from the victim's back pocket. The victim and her friends demanded the phone back, but the suspect said she had guns and threatened to kill. UW-Madison Police officers intercepted the suspect as she headed toward East Campus Mall and held her while the MPD responded. Released 09/19/2016 at 10:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
