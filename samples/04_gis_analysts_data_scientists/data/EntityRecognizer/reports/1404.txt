 A pizza delivery driver had just dropped off an order to a condo on East Bluff Sunday night when two men with bandanas over their faces approached. One pointed a handgun at the victim and demanded money. Instead, the victim ran and was able to get back to his car. He returned to his workplace and called police. Officers set up a perimeter but were able to locate those responsible for the attempted armed robbery. Released 11/15/2016 at 9:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
