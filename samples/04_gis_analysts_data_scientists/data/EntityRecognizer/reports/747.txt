Madison Police, working with Madison Metro, had a bus pull over on Shopko Dr. late this morning after a passenger said two teens in the back of the bus with a handgun. Officers got several uninvolved passengers off of the bus before entering and ordering the suspects to the floor. They turned out to be carrying multiple BB guns and BBs, as well as a couple of knives. They said they were heading to some woods to shoot the guns. Both were cited and released. The investigation is continuing.  Released 12/23/2015 at 2:09 PM by PIO Joel Despain
