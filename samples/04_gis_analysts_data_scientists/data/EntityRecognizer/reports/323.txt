On 11/17/2018 at approximately 12:56am, Madison Police Officers were dispatched to the 516 South Park Street (Rustic Tavern) regarding a weapons offense.  The victim was in the parking lot of the bar taking a break when he made innocuous eye contact with the suspect who took offense to this.  The suspect physically assaulted the victim and then pulled out a pistol, racked the slide (chambering a round), and pointed it at the victim.   When police arrived, the suspect did not comply with their lawful orders.  He was eventually taken into custody without incident.  Additionally, police recovered the handgun used during the commission of this crime and found it was loaded.  The suspect was believed to be intoxicated and was transported to the Central Police District where he did submit to an evidentiary chemical test of his breath.  Following this, the suspect was booked into the Dane County Jail on charges of 2nd Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety, Felon in Possession of a Firearm, Disorderly Conduct While Armed, Bail Jumping, and Battery.   Released 11/17/2018 at 4:15 AM by Sgt.
