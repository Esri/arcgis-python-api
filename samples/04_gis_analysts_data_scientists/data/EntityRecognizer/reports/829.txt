A loaded handgun, stolen from an unlocked pickup truck on Glacier Circle two weeks ago, was found tucked in the waistband of a 15-year-old suspect, who was spotted last night pacing outside the BP gas station, 6202 Schroeder Rd. The teen is banned from the property because of a prior shoplifting case. A second young man took off as police arrived. The arrested suspect told an officer he had no weapons or other contraband, but that turned out not to be true, as the loaded gun, plus an additional magazine containing seven bullets, and some marijuana were recovered from his waistband and pockets. The responding officers believed the teens were casing the gas station.  Released 08/30/2016 at 9:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
