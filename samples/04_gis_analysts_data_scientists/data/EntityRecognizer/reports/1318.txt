On 4/29/19, officers were dispatched to a minor, two-vehicle crash investigation at S Stoughton/Pflaum Rd.  Upon arrival, the officers noticed two individuals in one of the cars had overdosed.  The driver and passenger were unconscious and not breathing.  Officers quickly removed the occupants and began lifesaving efforts.  They performed cardiocerebral resuscitation (CCR) and also administered naloxone until paramedics arrived on scene.  As a result of their lifesaving efforts, both parties regained consciousness and were transported to an area hospital.  The driver of the vehicle was later arrested for Operating a Motor Vehicle while Impaired - 7th Offense.
