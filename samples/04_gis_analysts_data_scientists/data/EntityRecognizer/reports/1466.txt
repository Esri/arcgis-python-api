The victim was waiting for a bus in the bus stop on Odana Rd by Odana Ln when the suspect came up to her, asked her something, then grabbed her purse that was on the bench next to her and ran to a darker red SUV-type vehicle.  He was getting into the passenger side door and the victim followed, trying to grab at the purse to get it back.  The suspect pushed her down to the ground and got into the vehicle, which left the scene.  The purse was located nearby but it was empty and contents gone.  The victim was uninjured. It appears likely this suspect had first attempted a strong armed robbery at Woodman's at 711 S. Gammon Rd..  In that case the female adult victim held onto the purse and was dragged about 15 feet before the suspect let go and got into the passenger side door of a burgundy Ford Escape which had been reported stolen in early January.  The victim was uninjured in that case.  The driver of the vehicle in that incident was reported to be a m/b.  This occurred at approximately 10:35 am. At approximately 10:45am there was another attempted strong armed robbery in the parking lot of Hy-Vee at 675 S. Whitney Way where a young m/b suspect which the victim thought to be less than high school age tried to grab the purse off the shoulder of an adult female who was putting groceries in her vehicle.  After she yelled the suspect left without the purse and got into the passenger side of a darker red SUV, which left.  From there it seems they went directly to the bus stop at Odana Rd/Odana Ln and committed the strong armed robbery. Investigation continuing. UPDATE:  The stolen burgundy Ford Escape mentioned in the Woodman's robbery incident was recovered in Sun Prairie this evening. The investigation of all three of these robbery incidents is ongoing at this time. Released 01/21/2019 at 1:49 PM by Lt. John Radovan
