He told a bank teller, and later police, that he got the check for doing a painting job. He could not recall the name of the person who employed him, nor the address of the home where he had just worked. But he knew it to be blue and on Madison's West Side. The suspect had come to cash the $500 instrument yesterday at Chase Bank, 4513 Milwaukee St. In the memo line was the word "aint work," which struck the teller odd, and thus began contact with police and an ensuing investigation. The check's owner assured he had no paint job done recently, but he did have his car stolen. His checkbook had been inside. It was learned a second bogus check – for $500.60 - had been written on his account, and another financial institution had recently cashed it. Coincidently, the suspect had several hundred dollars in his wallet. The car containing the checkbook had been stolen Monday night. Its' owner, a 26-year-old Madison man -  was on N. Livingston St., unloading groceries, and had briefly left his 2013 Ford Taurus unlocked, with the keys inside.   The MPD found Taurus abandoned near the intersection of E. Mifflin St and N. Brearly St. a short time later. The suspect was arrested during a traffic stop following yesterday's attempted fraud. In running his name, officers quickly determined there was probable cause to also arrest him for a September check fraud case. It involved a 55-year-old McFarland man who had his checkbook stolen while he was teaching at the Straubel Community Center, 8 Straubel Court. Two of his checks, totally $2,200, had been cashed at Madison area credit unions. The suspect was identified by police thanks to a surveillance photo that had been captured at the time of one of the transactions.  Released 10/03/2018 at 11:10 AM by PIO Joel Despain
