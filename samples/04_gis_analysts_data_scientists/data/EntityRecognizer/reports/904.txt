It is estimated 50,000 to 70,000 enjoyed weather delayed fireworks at this year's Shake the Lake. Rain showers pushed back the show from 10:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Thousands lined the shoreline of Lake Monona, others grabbed views from boats and other venues as the event went off without major incidents for police; however, there were several groups of juveniles – 13 to 15-year-olds who did cause disturbances near Monona Terrace during, and immediately following fireworks. Some were posturing to fight. All were escorted out of the area by officers. The MPD thanks the vast majority of attendees for keeping festivities enjoyable and safe.   Released 06/25/2017 at 12:04 AM by PIO Joel Despain
