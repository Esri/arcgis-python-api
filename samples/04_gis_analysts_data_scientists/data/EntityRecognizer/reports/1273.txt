West District officers arrested a suspected burglar late yesterday afternoon after he tried to reenter Oakwood Village, 6205 Mineral Point Rd. An employee, working the front desk, recognized the suspect from a surveillance photo which had been shared with staff and residents of the retirement community. The employee asked the man to sign the check-in log book and inquired about who he planned to visit. The suspect decided to leave. Police were called, and he was contacted at a nearby bus stop. He is accused of burglarizing two apartments this week after residents left doors unlocked for a couple of minutes: in one case to take out the trash; in the other to get the newspaper. On Sunday morning, money and jewelry were taken from one apartment. On Tuesday afternoon, a wallet and purse were stolen from another. In both cases, it appeared the suspect entered the property though an underground parking garage door. The MPD had been working with Oakwood Village staff members on these cases, when the suspect returned to the scene of the crimes.  Released 09/13/2018 at 10:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
