A MPD detective arrested a former employee of a downtown assisted living facility yesterday following an investigation that began earlier this summer. The suspect, a 36-year-old Madison woman, is accused of stealing tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry from elderly residents over the past three years. Maritza R. Rodriguez-Monreal was identified after her past employer received a report of missing items from a resident's apartment. Police were contacted and the case detective used LeadsOnline to find dozens of pawn transactions connected to this case. The detective has been able to identify at least six victims and will be asking the district attorney to charge the suspect with multiple counts of felony theft.    Released 08/19/2016 at 12:39 PM by PIO Joel Despain
