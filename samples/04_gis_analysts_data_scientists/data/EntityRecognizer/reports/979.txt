 A W. Gilman St. resident was awakened by the sound of breaking glass early this morning, and began screaming when she realized a stranger was attempting to crawl into her bathroom. The victim grabbed her cell phone, ran outside, and called 911. A MPD officer was in the area and on scene almost immediately. He spotted legs hanging outside of a shattered first floor window, with the suspect seemingly stuck. As the officer demanded to see the man's hands, the intruder slid into the apartment. Officers cautiously ventured inside and found him lying in the bathtub. He was taken into custody without incident. The 21-year-old said he had been out socializing with friends, but could not explain why he broke into the victim's apartment. Released 02/10/2017 at 9:50 AM by PIO Joel Despain
