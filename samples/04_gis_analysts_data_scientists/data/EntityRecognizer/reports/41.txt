 A 17-year-old driver was cited for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated - causing injury, inattentive driving, resisting, and underage drinking last night following a crash on S. Stoughton Rd. Witnesses said the young woman was going about 50 mph when her car struck another that was stopped for a traffic light near Pflaum Rd. The collision caused significant damage to the involved vehicles and the intersection was partially shut down while debris was cleared. A passenger in the teen's car, a 19-year-old from Madison, was taken to a hospital where she was treated and released for a head injury. Released 11/06/2018 at 10:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
