Telephonic scam artists targeting older Madison residents are not new, and some do claim to be with law enforcement agencies, but this is believed to be the first time a criminal tried to pass himself off as MPD Chief Mike Koval. An 81-year-old West Side woman got a call last Tuesday from "Detective Russell Green" of the New York Police Department. "Det. Green" told the Madisonian he was tasked with an investigation into a Publishers Clearing House employee. As the saga goes, the Madison woman – unbeknownst to her - had actually had won a cash prize, but this no good employee was now trying to fraudulently collect the winnings. When the skeptical Madison woman began questioning "Det. Green," he told her he could have the local police chief call to verify the veracity of his probe. And sure enough, "Chief Mike Koval" was soon on the phone telling the woman she would need to wire $600 to New York in order to collect her prize money. The woman decided it prudent to call her son-in-law, an attorney, as this was not making sense. The son-in-law contacted the real MPD and confirmed what he already knew: the calls were part of a scam. A suspect did call the 81-year-old back, and she told him to contact her lawyer. She could have also told him to contact the real Chief Koval. Either one would have told the conmen to knock it off. As it was, the last suspect to call the victim hung up on her, and none has contacted her since.  Released 01/17/2017 at 2:32 PM by PIO Joel Despain
