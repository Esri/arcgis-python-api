The victim said, while down, he was kicked several times. He saw a group of six to ten teens runoff following the attack. He was not robbed and suffered a cut lip. The man was unable to provide detailed descriptions of the teens, but did say they appeared to be wearing mostly white clothing.    Released 05/30/2019 at 9:50 AM by PIO Joel Despain
