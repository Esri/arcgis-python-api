A woman was punched several times in the head early this morning while calling 911. She had just seen a man go inside an unlocked car that was parked near State St. and West Johnson St. The witness knew the car belonged to an Uber driver. When he returned she let him know what had happened. This upset the man who had gone into the car, and he charged at the woman, attacking her as she called for police. A bouncer from a downtown bar had just gotten off of work, and was on his way home. He saw what was happening and called for the woman to come to his truck while simultaneously yelling at the man to stop. The man fled prior to officers' arrival. The woman was transported to a hospital, but was not seriously injured. Released 10/26/2018 at 9:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
