 Several utility poles, and power lines connected to them, are down in the area of Hoboken Rd. and Lake Point Dr. at this hour. As a result, Hoboken between West Broadway and Weber Road is shut down. In addition, motorists cannot get through the intersection at Lake Point Dr. Crews are on scene repairing the damage, but traffic issues are expected for the next couple of hours.  This began around 8:40 a.m. when a truck struck and toppled one of the poles. As it went over, it created a chain reaction, pulling down two additional poles. Power lines fell on an occupied vehicle that was driving in the area. Those inside have gotten out safely and do not appear to be injured.  Released 04/04/2019 at 9:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
