A seven-year-old boy had been knocking on a locked convenience store bathroom door for 20 minutes when employees at Kwik Trip, 2402 W. Broadway decided it was time to call the police Wednesday afternoon. Officers and Madison Fire Department paramedics both responded. Inside the bathroom, they found drug paraphernalia and the child's unconscious father. Life-saving naloxone was delivered and the father became responsive. Officers let him know that his son was okay, but based on store surveillance video, had been left unattended for nearly an hour after the father entered the bathroom. The father couldn't believe he had done this. The child's mother arrived to take the boy home. The father is eligible for the MPD's Madison Addiction Recovery Initiative (MARI) which offers those who overdose the opportunity of a referral to treatment as an alternative to jail.  Released 06/13/2019 at 10:08 AM by PIO Joel Despain
