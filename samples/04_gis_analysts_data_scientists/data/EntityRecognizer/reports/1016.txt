A savvy Packers fan agreed to meet some unscrupulous salespeople in an attempt to purchase four tickets to tomorrow's Packers game.  The tickets were listed for sale on Craigslist and the potential buyer met the sellers at a gas station on Madison's west side.  The buyer noted that the tickets were not the proper size and did not have the proper picture on the ticket.  The buyer told the sellers that he didn't want the tickets and contacted the police. As always, when making purchasing from an online source, use caution.  Released 01/02/2016 at 7:28 PM by Lt. Kelly Donahue
