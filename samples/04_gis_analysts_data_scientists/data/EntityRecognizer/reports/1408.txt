Male and female who are in a domestic relationship engage in an argument.  During the argument the female armed herself with a kitchen knife.  There are two sides of the story as to why the female armed herself, but it resulted with the male receiving a cut to the arm.  The injury was non life threatening but did require medical treatment.  The female was arrested for recklessly endangering safety and the male was arrested on an outstanding warrant.
