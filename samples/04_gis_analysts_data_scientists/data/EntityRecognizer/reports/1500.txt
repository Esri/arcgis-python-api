 A parent and child were walking to school this morning when they spotted a handgun behind Leopold Elementary School, 2602 Post Rd. The loaded weapon was located at the far edge of the school's property, very close to Aldo Leopold Park. It had no rust and appeared to have been recently discarded. The gun was stolen in Fitchburg in 2016. It has been confiscated by the MPD. Released 03/15/2018 at 11:06 AM by PIO Joel Despain
