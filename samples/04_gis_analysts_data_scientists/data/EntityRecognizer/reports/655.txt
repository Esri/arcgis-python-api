At approximately 7:15pm a female was in the outdoor nature/conservancy area on the Edgewood campus playing a guitar.  The male suspect entered this area and left moments later, but then returned wearing no clothing.  The suspect told the female to "not leave", asked her "to just watch him", and that "this was a fantasy of his."  The female quickly averted her attention and began leaving as the male started fondling himself. Suspect was not located upon and initial area check.  Officers are working with campus secuity and an investigation is ongoing at this time.    Released 08/30/2017 at 9:47 PM by Sgt.
