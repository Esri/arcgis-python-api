 A 21-year-old man was transported to a hospital with head injuries following a morning mugging in the 800 block of Troy Dr. The victim flagged down a passerby following the attack, and told police it began when someone traveling in a blue car yelled at him. He was on foot. The victim gave the car the finger, and that's when the robber got out. He struck the victim multiple times in the head, knocking him down. The victim said the man also threatened to shoot him, although no weapon was seen. The man stole the victim's cell phone and fled. Released 07/06/2017 at 11:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
