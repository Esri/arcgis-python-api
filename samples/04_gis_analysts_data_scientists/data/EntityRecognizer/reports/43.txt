At least one gunshot was fired overnight following an armed robbery on Hauk St. Two men reported being robbed at gunpoint while standing near a car. The victims said three men approached and demanded they turn over their possessions. The victims lost a cell phone and money, and said one robber fired his weapon as the trio fled following the holdup. There were no reports of injuries or property damage, and responding officers did recover a shell casing. The preliminary investigation suggests this was a targeted robbery.
