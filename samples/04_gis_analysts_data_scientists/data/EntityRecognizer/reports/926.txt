A 25-year-old Madison woman was at her boyfriend's Camden Rd. apartment last night watching television when three masked men burst into the home. One pointed a gun at her, and forced her into a bathroom, while the other two rummaged through the residence. The gunman yelled, "where the money at?" The woman stayed quiet, but the intruders were able to find cash and flee. Shortly thereafter, the victim's 26-year-old boyfriend returned from an errand and police were called. Investigators believe this was a targeted home invasion. Released 01/04/2017 at 9:50 AM by PIO Joel Despain
