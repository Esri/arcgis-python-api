The driver of a truck was pronounced dead at a hospital this afternoon following a crash on Williamson St. Witnesses said the truck suddenly veered off of the road around 1:30 p.m. and struck a light pole. The preliminary investigation indicates the man most likely had some sort of medical emergency, and that caused his death, not the impact with the pole. He was operating a truck owned by his employer at the time of the accident. Released 09/15/2016 at 3:34 PM by PIO Joel Despain
