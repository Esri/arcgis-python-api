At 4:40 p.m., an attempted bank robbery occurred at 4513 Milwaukee Street, the Chase Bank.  Preliminary reports from witnesses reflect that a twenty-something year old Latino male entered the bank and subsequently covered his face and hands and walked to a teller window.  The suspect produced a bag and made a demand for money.  A private armed security guard, contracted by Chase, observed the suspect make a demand for money and subsequently confronted and shot the suspect, killing him. Despite attempts to render aid, the suspect succumbed to a single gunshot wound.  The Medical Examiner's Office was notified and the investigation is continuing.
