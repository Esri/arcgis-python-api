 The Women's March on Madison brought an estimated 75,000 to 100,000 to the downtown. At one point, all blocks of State Street were full, as was the Library Mall, and parts of the Capitol Square. The crowd was very well-behaved and the MPD had no serious problems or incidents. The MPD would like to thank motorists for their patience - as many roadways needed to be closed during the event - and a big thanks to all who attended and helped keep the peace.   Released 01/21/2017 at 3:21 PM by PIO Joel Despain
