 An Edgerton man, who had two children in his pickup truck, was arrested for his seventh offense of drunken driving Saturday afternoon. The MPD took the driver into custody after being called to the parking lot of Ho Chunk Casino, 4002 Evan Acres Rd. shortly before 1:00 p.m. Officers learned one child had earlier attempted to jump from the truck to avoid being inside a vehicle being driven by someone who had been drinking. The driver was taken to a hospital where he caused an estimated $3,000 damage to a bed before going to jail. Released 07/02/2018 at 11:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
