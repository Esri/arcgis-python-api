 Inside a stolen backpack was brick. It did not belong to the victim, but two laptop computers and other items in the backpack did. UW-Madison Police took a suspect into custody on warrants over the weekend, just as the MPD was taking another complaint from a victim who had a car window smashed during a theft inside the State Street Campus Ramp, 415 N. Lake Street. The victim, a 23-year-old woman reported the crime Saturday morning after leaving her car parked overnight. The suspect claimed he found stolen items, including the backpack, in some bushes near the ramp. The MPD contacted him at the Dane County Jail to let him know of new tentative felony charges stemming from the smash-and-grab. The inmate did not wish to make a statement, but did say: "Thanks for contacting me. That's another lawsuit." Last week the MPD issued a warning to citizens about recent break-ins at the ramp.
