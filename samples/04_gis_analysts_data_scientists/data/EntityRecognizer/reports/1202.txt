 A 73-year-old Madison man, out for a walk Monday morning, found a shell casing in the driveway of the BP gas station, 4222 E. Washington Ave. A responding officer located two more, bringing to three the number of spent casings. Earlier, around 12:10 a.m., an area resident called 911 after hearing what she thought were gunshots. The woman was unable to pinpoint where the reports had originated and no evidence was found in the darkness of night. It's believed casings found near the gas station likely correlate with what she heard. Released 04/24/2018 at 9:03 AM by PIO Joel Despain
