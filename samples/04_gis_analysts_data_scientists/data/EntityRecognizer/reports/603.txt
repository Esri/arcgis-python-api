The MPD is recommending a 42-year-old Sun Prairie man be charged with the second degree sexual assault of 19-year-old Madison woman. The suspect was with a couple of men who "crashed" a private party being at HotelRED, 1501 Monroe St., in the early morning hours of December 28th. The victim did not know the suspect, and was assaulted inside one of the hotel rooms. The suspect is a current client of the MPD's Special Investigations Unit and turned himself in on a probation and parole warrant last week.  Released 01/11/2016 at 11:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
