 The MPD tracked down a hit-and-run driver last night after 33-year-old Madison man escaped with minor injuries following a harrowing rear-end crash. The victim had been stopped at light on East Towne Blvd. His two daughters were in the back seat when the crash took place. The victim got out to check on his children. They were okay. He then went to check on the welfare of the suspect. As he did, the suspect drove at the victim, forcing him onto the hood of the suspect's car to avoid being run over. The suspect next accelerated, sending the victim to the pavement with arm and hand injuries. Based on information provided by the victim and other witnesses, officers were able to locate the drunken driver in the 4100 block of Lien Rd. He was arrested on tentative charges listed above.
