 A 34-year-old Madison man was not feeling well Friday afternoon, so he pulled his car over on Lumley Rd. and was taking a rest when someone rapped on the window, asking for a cigarette. The victim said he did not smoke. Suddenly his driver's side door popped open and four men pulled him to the pavement. Two held him down; one punched him in the head, while the fourth ran his pockets. The robbers took cash from his wallet and fled. He described his attackers as black males in their 40's with one wearing a bright orange hunting-style stocking cap. The victim said they got into a mid-90's blue Toyota - possibly a Corolla or a Camry - with rust on it and a damaged rear bumper. Released 10/23/2017 at 10:18 AM by PIO Joel Despain
