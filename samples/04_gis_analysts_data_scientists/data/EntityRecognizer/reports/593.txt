Shortly after 4:40am on 12/24/2015, Madison Police Officers were dispatched to the 1300 block of Ruskin Street, reference a man sitting in a vehicle with a gun.  Officers tactically approached the vehicle, and ordered the subject from the car at gun point.  The subject, later identified as Timothy Fleming, was initially detained so officers could investigate this matter further. Officers determined that the 37-year-old female caller had recently met Fleming, and after she had been conversing with him via cell phone, obliged a request to meet him on Ruskin Street.  The apprehensive female allowed Fleming into her vehicle, but noticed he was holding what appeared to be a silver colored handgun!  Fleming allegedly attempted to coax the female into driving up the street to meet some friends of his, but she started to have bad feelings about what his intentions might be.  She looked for alternatives to get him out of her car, but nothing worked.  The female finally fled her vehicle when she saw a female walking to a nearby residence, and she then made a call to police.  Officers obtained a very different statement from Fleming, and after searching the vehicle, located what was described as an exact metal replica of a Colt Defender handgun; a gun that was later determined to be a CO2 weapon.  Fleming was emphatic about not having done anything wrong, but he had clearly violated recently obtained bail conditions for a different case, due to alcohol consumption.  Fleming was conveyed to the Dane County Jail on all charges listed. PO Howard Payne  Released 12/28/2015 at 1:45 PM by P.O.
