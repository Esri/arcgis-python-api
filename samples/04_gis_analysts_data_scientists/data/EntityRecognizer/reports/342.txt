 There was an armed robbery Sunday night at the Mobil gas station, 605 Cottage Grove Rd. A sickly looking man, with blue eyes and sunken cheeks, demanded money from the till while making it look like he might have a gun tucked in his pants. The frightened clerk gave him cash and the robber fled. It's believed the getaway car is a silver Hyundai Sonata or Elantra. Anyone with information on the identity of the criminal can contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014. Released 01/02/2019 at 10:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
