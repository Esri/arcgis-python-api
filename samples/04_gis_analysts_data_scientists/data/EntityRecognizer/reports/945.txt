A burglar entered an Atwood Ave. restaurant through an unlocked door early this morning and stole a cash from an office. An employee, who was outside, saw the intruder walk away from the Alchemy Cafe, 1980 Atwood Ave. His description is very similar to that of a thief who stole cash from a nearby restaurant on July 30th. In that case a man got into a backroom of the Green Owl restaurant, 1970 Atwood Ave., around 12:30 p.m. He stole money belonging to an employee, and was seen leaving the area on a bicycle.
