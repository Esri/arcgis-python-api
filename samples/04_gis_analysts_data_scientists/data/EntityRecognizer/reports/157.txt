 When a Concord Ave. resident saw a stranger trying in his neighbor's backyard, trying to steal a bicycle Monday morning, he decided to take action. The 43-year-old jumped a fence and confronted the suspect. The teen initially tried to ride the bike from the area, but soon abandoned it and fled on foot. The witness followed, recording everything on his cell phone. The suspect stopped running long enough to knock the phone from the witness's hand. Police were called and the victim provided officers with a description  and direction of travel. That proved to be very useful as police located and arrested the suspect.  Released 10/03/2017 at 9:41 AM by PIO Joel Despain
