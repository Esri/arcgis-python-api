The MPD chased down and arrested a suspect in the 4400 block of Cottage Grove Rd. earlier today after a woman claimed the man pointed a gun at her. The suspect had recently been living in the victim's home, and forced entry into the house just prior to the reported gun play. The victim was not injured. The suspect was carrying a baby in a car seat at the time he was contacted by police. He dropped the infant when he ran. The baby – who is believed to be the suspect's child - was not hurt, and the suspect was not armed at the time of the apprehension. He has not yet been positively identified, and the investigation is ongoing. Released 05/17/2019 at 4:02 PM by PIO Joel Despain
