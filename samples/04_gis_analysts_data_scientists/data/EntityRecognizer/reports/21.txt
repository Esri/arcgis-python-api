     The MPD recovered stolen cash, burglarious tools, and arrested one of two suspects following an early morning smash-and-grab burglary at Mounds Pet Food Warehouse, 2110 S. Stoughton Rd.     The MPD was actually called twice to the business. At 1:30 a.m. officers responded to an alarm and found front door glass shattered. Criminals fled before making entry, and a manager used plywood to cover the damaged door.     Two hours later, the manager contacted the MPD after finding someone had removed the plywood. The MPD responded with two police dogs: K9 Bowie and K9 Falko. Suspects were seen running from the store. One, Darryl R. Howard, age 28, Madison was chased down and arrested for burglary and resisting. The other got away. In their path officers found a box containing stolen Mounds' money bags. A crowbar and screwdriver were also recovered. Released 03/18/2019 at 9:51 AM by PIO Joel Despain
