 A construction worker called in what he thought was a fight taking place outside of a West Wilson St. apartment building early this morning. It turned out to be a tenant who had just dragged an intruder out of his home after the stranger refused to leave. The victim had been awakened by the suspect's presence, and realized the drunken man had come in through an open window after removing a screen. The suspect maintained he had been partying in the victim's apartment earlier in the night, something the victim said was patently untrue. The suspect was arrested for felony trespass.
