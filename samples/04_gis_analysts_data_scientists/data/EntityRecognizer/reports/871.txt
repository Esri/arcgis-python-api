 Officers were originally sent to a parking lot on Waunona Woods Court this morning for a report of gunshots. When they arrived they discovered projectiles had been fired, but they weren't bullets. They were blue-colored paintballs. Several vehicles parked in the lot were struck. Witnesses reported seeing a passenger in a car doing the shooting.
