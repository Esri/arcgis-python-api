 There were many 911 calls from upset neighbors as a large and loud high school graduation party spilled into nearby yards, driveways and the roadway along normally quiet Manitowoc Parkway Saturday night. Officers reported several hundred either in or outside of the home where a 19-year-old woman was hosting the gathering. She understood why officers were asking her to shut things down. When one inquired why so many had come to her graduation celebration, she stated: "Because I am popular. Isn't it obvious?" The officer agreed that did seem to be the case. One ignoring the MPD's orders to leave the area was a man driving a convertible. He decided to pump up the volume on his car stereo, and with the top down, this became something of a rolling dance party as crowds of people gathered in and around his car as he drove up and down the block. Officers said he was operating aggressively and recklessly, nearly striking pedestrians and parked vehicles that lined the crowded street as he executed a series of Y-turns. As songs played, the driver – at times- led chants against police. He was arrested on numerous tentative charges. Peace and quiet along the parkway was restored.
