When a S. Park St. restaurant was burglarized early Friday morning, a criminal made off with 10 wireless karaoke microphones and a dozen bottles of spirits - including a couple that were high-end. The manager of Ichiban Sichuan placed the total dollar loss at close to $2,500. The burglar did leave a pretty good clue behind: a hospital bag with discharge papers containing his name and date of birth. He had been released from an emergency room late Thursday night, and investigators were able to match hospital surveillance images with others captured by the restaurant's cameras. Officers were familiar with the suspect, and knew him to be singer; however, they did not look for him at a karaoke club, but on State Street, where he they spotted him Friday night - in the 600 block - collecting tips for songs. Next to the him was a plastic bag containing the microphones, as well as some of the stolen liquor and wine.  Released 12/14/2015 at 10:45 AM by PIO Joel Despain
