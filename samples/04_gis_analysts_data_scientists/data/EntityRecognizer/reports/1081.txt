Several deli employees and a diner - who happened to be an off-duty Menasha police lieutenant - pinned down a burglary suspect Saturday afternoon, and held him until the MPD was on scene at Stalzy's Deli, 2701 Atwood Ave. The suspect had come into the restaurant and asked to use the bathroom. Instead he went to a basement office and stole an envelope filled with money. Employees recognized the burglar as possibly being the same person who likely stole money from the deli office this past May. They confronted the suspect. He tried to run but there was strength in numbers, and was stopped in his tracks. While being booked into jail, he was found to have concealed the stolen money in his undergarments.
