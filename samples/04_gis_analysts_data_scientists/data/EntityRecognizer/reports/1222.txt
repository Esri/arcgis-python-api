After he was detained early this morning, a 21-year-old Madison man admitted to officers he had  called 911 "so I could get popped," by police. Responding officers were told the downtown resident was suicidal and had a loaded gun. They found him marching around W. Main St. and Broom St. He did have a handgun in his left hand. For 20 minutes officers tried to negotiate with the distraught man, encouraging him to drop the weapon. He refused. When the man was in within 30 feet of one officer, the officer deployed a beanbag round from a shotgun. It hit the man in the buttocks or lower back. The officer yelled for him to drop the gun. He pivoted toward the officer. The officer deployed a second beanbag round, striking the man in the upper thigh. He still would not drop the weapon. A third beanbag round hit his left hand, causing him to finally drop the gun. The officer advanced quickly, ordering the man to get on the ground. When he did not, the officer tackled him The officer told the man he was going to be fine and to take some deep breaths. The man was taken to a hospital, not because of physical injuries, but so he could get help for his emotional state. The weapon, which looked very real, turned out to be a BB gun.      Released 08/22/2018 at 9:38 AM by PIO Joel Despain
