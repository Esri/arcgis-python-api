 The MPD recovered 50 "For Motion Picture Use Only" bills following a weekend arrest on the North Side. A PDQ clerk called for police after several men entered the store, located at 1434 Northport Dr. He believed one had been present when a counterfeit bill was recently passed. Police located a vehicle nearby and contacted the men. The driver had some prop money in his pockets and more was located in the car he was operating. There were 11 $100 bills and 39 $50 bills; all marked "For Motion Picture Use Only." The suspect was arrested on warrants, including one for carrying a concealed weapon. He's accused of dropping or tossing a handgun while being chased by North District officers in June of 2015.   Released 01/25/2017 at 1:07 PM by PIO Joel Despain
