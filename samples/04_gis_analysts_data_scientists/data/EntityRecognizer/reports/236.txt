 A Vera Court resident said a stranger came to his door Wednesday afternoon asking for money. The 68-year-old told the man no, and tried to close his door. He told the MPD the intruder pushed his way in, knocked him down, and fled with his wallet and cell phone. Released 06/23/2016 at 2:18 PM by PIO Joel Despain
