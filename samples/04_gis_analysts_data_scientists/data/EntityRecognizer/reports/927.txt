 Several distraught people, including a 43-year-old Camus Lane resident, called police Friday after a disturbing pornographic video showed up in their Facebook Messenger application. It was of a young girl performing a sex act on an adult male. There was also a short message saying, in part, "Please help her." The MPD obtained a copy of the video, and told anyone else receiving it to delete it. It is not known where it originated, and it appears to have been randomly disseminated, with a television newsroom being among addresses sent the material.
