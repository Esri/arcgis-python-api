 A Sun Prairie man finished his workout Thursday morning at Planet Fitness, 41 East Towne Mall. He went into the locker room and discovered his lock was gone, as was his wallet. He quickly learned his credit card had already been used to make several purchases at different mall stores. An investigating officer was able to retrace the thief's path using surveillance video. The suspect was found and arrested at the mall. He had some of the victim's property in his pocket. Released 12/07/2018 at 9:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
