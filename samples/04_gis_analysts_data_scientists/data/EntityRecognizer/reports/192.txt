A block of W. Doty St. was shut down for an hour this morning as the MPD negotiated with an armed man who had created a disturbance inside the foyer of the Public Safety Building. A Dane County Sheriff's deputy reported the suspect was stabbing at PSB window glass with a knife. MPD responded with many officers to include a trained MPD SWAT negotiator and two MPD Mental Health Liaison Program officers. Less lethal options, including the relatively new 40mm launcher were also brought to the scene. Negotiations were ultimately successful and the suspect was taken into custody without anyone getting hurt. Released 03/20/2018 at 10:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
