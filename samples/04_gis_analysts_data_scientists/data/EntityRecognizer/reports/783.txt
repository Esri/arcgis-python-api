 On 7/30/2018, a MPD officer was sent to the Dane County Humane Society reference a burglary, which had occurred sometime overnight.  The officer and staff members began to evaluate both damaged donation boxes/locks, and at least $200.00 in missing cash; which were donations from individuals that had been contributed for the purposes of Humane Society program improvement(s).  When video surveillance footage was being observed, staff members readily recognized Otis B. Adams; a grounds assistant employee for the Dane County Humane Society!  Adams was seen taking a stick and manipulating the camera angles so they would not capture his criminal activities. Adams' efforts were lacking, as he attempted to reposition the cameras, but left a fragment of his operational efforts still within recorded view; a view that showed Adams was taking US Currency out of the donation boxes and not making the expected type of contribution.  Adams, through his employment, had accessed the building with a provided key, but was working well after hours and at a time that no other employees were on site. Officers continued to develop intelligence in this case, in order to find the location of Adams, but it was not until 8/3/2018 that a parole violation was also added to the list of problems that he would have to soon deal with.  Shortly after 11:52am, multiple officers responded to the 5100 block of Voges Road, a rather convenient location to that of the burglary site of the Humane Society, and took Otis into custody at his residence on all charges listed.  PO Howard Payne Released 08/03/2018 at 4:09 PM by P.O.
