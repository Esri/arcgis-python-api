 A 24-year-old Madison man was about to get on his motorcycle, after shopping at West Towne Mall last night, when a man claiming to be a security guard approached. The stranger had just gotten out of gold-colored sedan. He was clad in a tight-fitting ribbed tank top, saggy pants, and had a white T-shirt or do-rag wrapped around his head. It seemed obvious to the cyclist that this was not really mall security. The man told the victim that there had been some sort of incident at the mall and he demanded the shopper turn over his backpack. When the victim refused, the man lifted his shirt and placed a hand on a gun that was tucked in his waistband. At that moment, the cyclist – who already had his helmet on – fired up his bike and got out of there. When he got to a safe location, and was no longer operating the bike, he called 911 to report the attempted robbery.
