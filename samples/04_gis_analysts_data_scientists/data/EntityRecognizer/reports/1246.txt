Florida investigators say a missing teenager may have been in the Madison area in recent years following her 2013 disappearance. Detectives from the Bay County Sheriff's Office are marking the third anniversary of the day Emily W. Paul left her Southport, Florida home with a renewed plea for help. Emily was 14 when she vanished on April 13, 2013. Investigators believe she left on her own accord and was picked up by someone with whom she was acquainted. She was last known to be 4'10", about 100 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. Her ears were pierced and she was wearing braces. Emily would now be 17 and Bay County detectives remain committed to reuniting her with her family. Anyone with information on Emily's whereabouts can contact the Bay County Sheriff's Office in Panama City at 850-747-4700, or they can leave information anonymously at Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.
