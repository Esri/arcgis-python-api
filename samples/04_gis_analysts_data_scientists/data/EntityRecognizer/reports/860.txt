 An East Towne Mall employee was attacked and battered inside a vestibule near the Food Court doors Monday afternoon. Following the assault, the victim realized his iPhone 7 was gone, as was the suspect. Another employee was able to track the phone with a "find my phone" app. Information on the location of the phone was provided to the MPD and the suspect was located walking on E. Washington Ave. He was arrested and the phone recovered. The victim told police the stranger initially asked him for a cigarette just prior to throwing a volley of punches. The suspect was with a woman who was pushing a baby in a stroller. She was cited for being party to the theft, but not physically arrested. The suspect went to jail on tentative battery and theft charges. The victim suffered head injuries but he did not need to go to a hospital. Released 01/24/2017 at 10:52 AM by PIO Joel Despain
