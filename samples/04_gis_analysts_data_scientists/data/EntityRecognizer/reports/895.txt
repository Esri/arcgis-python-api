Victim of an armed robbery reported to police that she had agreed via text messaging to meet the suspect at her residence.  Suspect stayed for a brief period of time, and then left.  He then returned a short time later, and when the victim opened the door for him to re-enter, a second suspect also entered the residence, carrying a handgun.  Suspect number 1 took victim's purse and a phone, and reportedly told suspect number 2 to shoot the victim before both suspects fled without any shots being fired.  Investigation is continuing.
