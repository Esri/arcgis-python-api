 A 57-year-old Madison woman reports being mugged Friday night while walking on Mendota St., near Hoover Dr. The victim says a man ran up from behind, pushed her down, and took her backpack. It contained her wallet and other items. She did not report the crime for several hours, telling police she had been drinking and wanted to go home and go to sleep before contacting the MPD.
