 A Pulaski teenager, in Madison for the 73rd State Individual Wrestling Tournament, was attacked by several men early Sunday morning. The 17-year-old was crossing Conklin Place, walking behind a group of friends, when two cars and a minivan drove in his direction. He put his hand out to stop them, and the lead car came to a halt within inches of his reach. He placed his hand on the hood of the car. This evidently angered several of those in the vehicles, who apparently were caravanning together. The teen said 6 to 8 jumped out of the cars and minivan. He was punched several times, knocked down, and then had his head stomped on twice. He was transported to a hospital with head injuries that required stitches. A couple of his friends ran back to his location during the 30-second attack. They arrived just as the attackers got back in vehicles and quickly left. They were described as black males. Some were traveling in a white Dodge Intrepid, others in a blue Dodge Grand Caravan. Anyone with information on their identities is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.
