A pair of walkie-talkies, a well-placed surveillance camera, and the jig was up last night. Patrol officers responded to a burglar alarm coming from a construction site on Creekwood Lane. They found this is a multi-story apartment building, which is under construction and surrounded by a security fence. Soon, the project manager was on the phone saying he was at home, but able to monitor surveillance video coming from the site. He had seen a white van circling the area with at least one person getting inside the gated area. Officers began a search, and located a woman hiding near some copper wire. The project manager said they have been having a problem with "copper thieves." However, in this case, the woman assured she was simply homeless and was just crashing here for the night. Upon searching her, officers discovered she had a walkie-talkie. She said she "didn't know where that came from." A female officer turned it on and whispered: "Where are you?" A male voice responded: "I'm in the same spot. I'm in the same spot." Officers would soon fine a white van parked not far from the construction site. Two people, a man and a woman, were inside. They also said they were homeless, and were parked in the area to get some sleep. They denied anyone else was with them. The man consented to a search of the van. And, wouldn't you know it, a second walkie-talkie was found. It was on the same channel as the other walkie-talkie, and officers were soon conversing. The ensuing investigation resulted in the arrests of all three. Released 02/21/2019 at 12:53 PM by PIO Joel Despain
