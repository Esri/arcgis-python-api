Officers were called to the Meadowridge Library just before closing for a disturbance. When Officers arrived, a security guard and the suspect were engaged in a physical altercation in the entry way to the library. According to witnesses, cabinets and the entry door were damaged as the security guard tried to escort the individual out of the library before police arrived. The security guard attempted to close and lock the library door but the suspect forced back entry to restart the physical struggle. The suspect resisted Officers and tried to flee, eventually being arrested for disorderly conduct, resisting, battery, damage to property, bail jumping and a parole violation.
