MPD crime analysts are noticing an uptick in burglaries where underground parking garages are being targeted. Once inside, criminals are breaking vehicle windows and stealing items. In several cases backpacks have been taken. There have been cases reported in several parts of the city with the West District experiencing the greatest number. Most recently, this past weekend, two cars parked beneath a Harbour Town Drive apartment building were hit. Crime analysts have found nearly 25 reported similar cases since the first of the year with most being reported between Friday nights and Sunday mornings. They offer the following prevention tips: Be mindful when entering and exiting parking structures. Report suspicious behavior to police and management. Report door malfunctions to apartment complex staff. Do not prop open doors to and from apartment complex or garage. Do not fall for the ruses like, "I live here and forgot my keys. Can you let me in so I can get my car?" When parked, do not leave items in plain view and lock your doors.     Released 03/07/2019 at 12:06 PM by PIO Joel Despain
