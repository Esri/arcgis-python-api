An 86-year-old woman contacted the MPD after providing personal information to a caller who claimed to be contacting her on behalf of the Medicaid program. The man told the woman she had qualified to receive several items to help improve her quality of life including back and arm braces. He said he needed to confirm certain information, and the woman believes she gave him her Medicaid and social security numbers. A family member told her this was likely a fraud attempt, and the woman verified this to the case with representatives of the real Medicaid program. The responding officer told her to stay in contact with Medicaid, and to also alert the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security about the situation, just in case. She had already contacted her bank about the call.  Released 03/27/2019 at 10:28 AM by PIO Joel Despain
