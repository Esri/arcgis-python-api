A battery victim grabbed a can of Raid and a bottle to defend himself after being attacked by strangers Wednesday afternoon inside a convenience store. The victim said a man – who was in the company of a woman friend – had asked him for money just before he entered La Hispana Taqueria, 4512 E. Washington Ave. He declined the request. As he was making a purchase, the man and woman entered the store. The man had taken off his belt and began whipping the victim. The suspects also delivered a series of punches. The victim responded by grabbing the Raid and spraying the male suspect. He also hit the man with a bottle. An employee called police. The assault was captured on surveillance video. The suspects were located and arrested. The victim suffered head injuries. Released 06/08/2017 at 11:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
