 A 22-yar-old bicyclist suffered a brain bleed after colliding with a car yesterday afternoon. Witnesses said the biker was peddling on the sidewalk heading outbound along E. Washington Ave. She entered the crosswalk at Blair St., just as a motorist had a green light to turn right from inbound E. Washington Ave. onto Blair St. The driver said the cyclist "came out of nowhere" and struck his car near its hood. The accident is under investigation.
