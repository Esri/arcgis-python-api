     Officers working in MPD's Criminal Intelligence Section report an uptick in stolen cars around Dane County over the weekend. At least ten were taken, with some being driven away following home burglaries and others swiped after owners left vehicles unlocked with keys inside.     In the video clip, a thief exits one stolen car to steal another on Milky Way around 2:00 a.m. this morning. At third car that pulls up was also one of those reported taken in the county. The Milky Way car was located several hours later on Allied Dr. Detectives believe the same ring of young people who have made headlines stealing cars in the past are connected to the recent thefts.     Many of these crimes could be prevented if cars were left locked with no keys inside.     For instance, on Saturday a 26-year-old Cross Plains man left his car unlocked and running as he went into a fast-food restaurant on Regent St. for a minute of two. He looked out to see someone driving away in his 2015 Toyota Corolla.   Released 04/22/2019 at 2:56 PM by PIO Joel Despain
