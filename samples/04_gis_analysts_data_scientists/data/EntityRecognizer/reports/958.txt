A Madison woman said an aggressive panhandler followed her Sunday evening as she walked in the 300 block of W. Dayton St. As he would not leave her alone, she pulled out her cellphone and told him she was going to call 911. He responded by grabbing her purse and taking off. Central District officers were able to find the crime on video, and could see the strong-armed robber dumping the purse near a bike rack on State Street. Officers recovered it as well as some of the victim's property; however, they were unable to quickly identify and arrest a suspect. Released 02/11/2019 at 9:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
