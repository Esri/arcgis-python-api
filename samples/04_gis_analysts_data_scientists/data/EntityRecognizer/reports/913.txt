 A woman, whose bicycle was recently stolen, worked with the MPD Monday to get it back. In the process, a suspect - who refused to identify himself - was booked into the Dane County Jail as John Doe. The 23-year-old victim had her Trek bicycle taken from her Erin St. home. The $700 bike next popped up on Craig's List for sale at $175 "firm." The victim spotted the listing and contacted the seller. An arrangement was made to meet near Library Mall, in the 700 block of State St., around 6:30 yesterday evening. Prior to the rendezvous', the victim contacted the MPD, and officers were in position when the suspect arrived with her stolen bike. When they asked the man questions, including what his name might be, they mostly got a blank stare in return. The suspect - a white male who looks like he is in his 50's - said something about having the right to remain silent. Efforts to identify him are ongoing. He was carrying a backpack containing a laptop computer and tools officers thought could be used to cut bike locks.
