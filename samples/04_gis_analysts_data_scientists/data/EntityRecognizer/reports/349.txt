MPD K9 Bowie successfully tracked down a suspect wanted on multiple outstanding warrants after the suspect fled from MPD officers downtown early Sunday morning. It all started when officers assigned to MPD's Downtown Safety Initiative (DSI) observed a physical confrontation between Buckingham and another adult male near the intersection of State Street and W Gilman Street. When MPD officers contacted Buckingham due to his involvement in the disturbance, Buckingham fled on foot leading officers on a foot chase through downtown. Buckingham was able to briefly elude officers after he scaled a wood fence that was approximately 6ft tall. Not to be deterred, MPD officers flooded the area and K9 Bowie was brought in to assist with the search. K9 Bowie tracked the suspect to a dumpster. When officers opened the lid on the dumpster, Buckingham was found hiding inside. MPD officers then took Buckingham into custody and booked him into jail on multiple outstanding warrants with a new charge of resisting arrest added for leading officers on the foot chase.
