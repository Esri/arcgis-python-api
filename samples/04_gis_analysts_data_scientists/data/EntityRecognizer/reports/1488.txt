Officers counseled passengers, who had been inside a stolen car, just how dangerous their actions could have been had officers seen them trying to hide a handgun after the MPD had ordered everyone to keep hands up. A 71-year-old Platteville woman had left the car unlocked, with keys inside, and it was stolen from her home Friday night. The MPD spotted it operating in the 2200 block of Carling Dr. Sunday afternoon, and pulled it over at gunpoint. As mentioned, all inside were ordered to keep hands up. The front seat passenger, a 19-year-old admitted there was a .38 special under his seat, and instead of quickly following police orders, he reached down and handed the gun back. Behind him were two younger teens – ages 14 and 15 – as well as a suspect who was ultimately arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. "I explained to (the front seat passenger) that his action endangered the lives of everyone in the car," an officer wrote in his report. "(He) seemed to take this to heart, and actually apologized to his friends for his actions. The car's driver and the passenger - who possessed the gun - were arrested on tentative charges listed above. The others were released.Officers did not know there was a handgun in the car until it was found in a seat pocket.   Released 09/26/2016 at 12:18 PM by PIO Joel Despain
