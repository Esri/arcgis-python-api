MPD officers responded to the area of Oakridge Ave. and Ohio Ave. this morning regarding a call that originally came in as a possible abduction.  What resulted was an arrest for operating a motor vehicle without the owner's consent stemming from a reported carjacking that occurred in Milwaukee earlier in the day. It was thanks to the keen observations and intervention of a Madison mom, who was taking her son to school, that enabled MPD to do timely follow-up that resulted in the arrest. At the outset, our "hero" in all of this was a woman who trusted her eyes and her instincts to sense something was wrong.  While taking her son to school, the Madison mom witnessed a man placing his hands on a young woman. Something appeared amiss. The mom looked in her rearview mirror and could see a frightened look on the girl's face. The Good Samaritan placed her car in reverse, and as she did the man began to walk away.  The witness gathered the young girl into the safety of her own car and called 9-1-1 to provide additional descriptive information to responding MPD units.  Officers quickly located the car and the suspect and placed him under arrest.  A recovered facsimile handgun was found in the stolen car. The investigation is continuing with respect to what occurred in the interaction between the suspect and 15-year-old girl.  Consistent with preventative protocols, school officials were made aware of this incident in the event that the school district wanted to make parents/students/staff aware of the fact that an incident had occurred involved a student from MMSD on her way to school. The Good Samaritan will be nominated for a MPD departmental award.    Released 03/24/2017 at 2:28 PM by PIO Joel Despain
