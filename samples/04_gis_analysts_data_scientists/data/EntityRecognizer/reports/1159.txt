 The MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit is looking at possible connections between three recent bar burglaries where criminals pried open doors and stole safes containing cash. Early Monday morning, officers were dispatched to the Tip Top Tavern, 601 North Street, following the latest break-in. The Tip Top Tavern experienced a similar burglary on November 6th.Earlier this month burglars hit the Rockhound Brewing Company, 444 S. Park St. Video surveillance from both businesses shows two men wearing hoodies committing the crimes and using office chairs to roll safes out of buildings. Anyone with information on these crimes is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014. Released 12/18/2018 at 10:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
