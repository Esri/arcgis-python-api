 An 8-year-old girl told police a stranger chased her and some other children as they played near railroad tracks not far from Vera Court Thursday evening. The child said the man grabbed the sweatshirt of one boy, but the children were all able to run to an apartment and get away from the man. She said he yelled "hey" at them, but said nothing more.
