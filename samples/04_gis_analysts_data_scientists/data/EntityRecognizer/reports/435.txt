 A 21-year-old Madison woman had her car stolen while working out at a Westside health club Saturday, and MPD crime analysts say this is just the latest in a string of similar thefts that have occurred recently at area gyms. As was the case this past weekend, most crimes involve a young woman, or women getting into locker rooms and then checking unlocked lockers for car keys, cash and credit cards. In many cases, victims are finding items not only stolen from unlocked lockers, but that their cars have also been taken. These crimes are happening in Madison, and in surrounding communities to include Middleton and Fitchburg. The MPD urges gym members to lock valuables, and to be alert to suspicious behavior.   Released 06/03/2019 at 3:24 PM by PIO Joel Despain
