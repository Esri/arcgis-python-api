The MPD is seeking help locating a missing 24-year-old Madison woman. Caprice Alexander lives on Adderbury Lane and went for a walk around 5:30 p.m. yesterday. She did not return. There is no reason to believe Caprice is the victim of foul play but there is concern for her welfare as she is on medication. Caprice is 5'8' and 220 pounds. She was wearing a black t-shirt, cameo shorts, and a yellow headband. Her hair was in a ponytail. Anyone with information on her whereabouts can call MPD's nonemergency number 255-2345.  Released 09/15/2017 at 10:18 AM by PIO Joel Despain
