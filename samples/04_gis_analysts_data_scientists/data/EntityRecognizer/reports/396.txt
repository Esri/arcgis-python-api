Two men escaped serious injury on Northport Dr. late this morning after a bullet struck the windshield of the car in which they were traveling. One suffered cuts from flying glass as a round pierced the front window, went out the back window, and bounced off of the trunk. Investigators do not believe either victim was an intended target, but were just driving down the road when someone inside a maroon car began firing. It is not clear what the gunman was shooting at, but officers have recovered numerous shell casings. Released 08/21/2017 at 12:43 PM by PIO Joel Despain
