 An Illinois man - who was visiting over the weekend - is being credited with apprehending one of three teens who tried to run from police after crashing a stolen car on Highland Ave. early Sunday morning. The car was taken a short time earlier from the 400 block of W. Main St. Its owner, a 51-year-old Baraboo man, said he had fallen asleep inside and left it unlocked. He awoke to the teens rummaging around inside the car. They ran off when they realized it was occupied, but took the victim's keys and phone. He was walking to get help, when he saw his car zoom past. The teens were inside, and out for a joyride. A Madison Police officer spotted the car and attempted to stop it near N. Park St. and W. Dayton St. The driver accelerated and the officer did not pursue. Witnesses watched as it crashed into a retaining wall minutes later after the speeding driver failed to execute a successful turn from Campus Dr. onto Highland Ave. They took off with officers from UW Police, Shorewood Hills, Veterans Hospital, and Madison arriving to give foot chase. Officers nabbed two, and a 41-year-old Illinois man - who was walking in the area - grabbed the third. The suspect begged him to let him go saying his mother would be very upset. The Illinois man did not acquiesce. He suffered some minor scrapes, and aggravated a prior knee injury during the apprehension. Police thanked him for his timely assistance.
