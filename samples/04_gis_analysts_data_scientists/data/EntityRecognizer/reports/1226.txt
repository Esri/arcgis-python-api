A woman was walking on a bike path near S. Brittingham Place this past Friday afternoon when a stranger grabbed her buttocks. He asked if she wanted to have sex with him and continued to follow her for a short period of time. She repeatedly told him to get away and he eventually turned and walked toward an area of tall grass near Brittingham Bay.  Released 12/14/2015 at 3:45 PM by PIO Joel Despain
