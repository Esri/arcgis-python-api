 A disagreement between several people at the top of State Street escalated last night when one party produced a box cutter and threatened another. There were small children in the area, and a 45-year-old woman witnessing the violence thought they could be in danger. Upset, she confronted the man who had wielded the box cutter. He responded by threatening her with the weapon. She went inside a nearby restaurant and called police. Officers utilized downtown surveillance cameras to view the crime and identify a suspect. He was found in the area and arrested on tentative charges listed above. Released 04/28/2018 at 3:27 PM by PIO Joel Despain
