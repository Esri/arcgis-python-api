A Thierer Rd. Dollar Tree employee had a handgun pointed at him and had his life threatened following a dispute over a purchase yesterday afternoon. The 27-year-old victim said the gunman was not present during the initial discussion with shoppers who wanted to collect previously purchased merchandise without a receipt. One had forgotten to take items he bought with him on the day prior. It was an acquaintance of this patron who came in later with the gun. He fled as the employee called police.  Released 01/22/2016 at 10:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
