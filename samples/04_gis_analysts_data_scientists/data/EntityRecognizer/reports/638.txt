The MPD has probable cause to arrest a 40-year-old Madison area woman for first degree reckless endangering safety after she stabbed a man in the face yesterday morning. The knife nearly penetrated the victim's carotid artery, which could have proven fatal. As it is, the 26-year-old Madison man needed numerous stitches both in and outside of his mouth. He was confronted by the suspect, and a couple of other woman, in a West Terrace Drive parking lot. The suspect swung a knife at him several times as she chased him around his car. He was eventually able to get into it and drive away. The victim is in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the suspect. She has not yet been located. The MPD was contacted about the stabbing after the victim arrived at a hospital. Released 04/02/2019 at 9:14 AM by PIO Joel Despain
