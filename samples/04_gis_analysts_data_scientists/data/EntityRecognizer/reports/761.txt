One of two purse thieves threw a handgun into the snow yesterday afternoon as shoppers chased the teens out of Woodman's, 711 S. Gammon Rd. Witnesses thought the discarded weapon was real, but officers determined it to be a facsimile. The fleeing teens had sneaked up on a 72-year-old woman as she was shopping for a box of cereal. One snatched her purse from a shopping cart and both took off running, with the victim in pursuit. She was yelling: "He's got my purse! Stop that man! He has my purse!" Other shoppers confronted the thieves. The purse was dropped. The fake gun was tossed, and both teens were last seen running down Schroeder Rd. MPD has identified one after checking surveillance video. He has not yet been located. He is 14-year-old. Back at the grocery store, the victim – who now had her purse back – took a seat on a bench for several minutes in order to calm down. She still needed to get her shopping done before braving the cold and getting back home.  Released 01/31/2019 at 10:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
