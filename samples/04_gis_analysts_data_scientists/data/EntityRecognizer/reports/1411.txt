At 6:32pm, a report of shots fired, in the 1800 block of Helene Parkway, was called into the 911 Center.  Officers responded and were able to recover bullet casings in the area.  Officers believe that one person was shooting at another and that both of the subjects left the area in vehicles.  A third subject was taken into custody, after a foot pursuit, several blocks away from the shooting.  It is unclear at this time what that person's involvement in the shooting was. One vehicle and two buildings were struck by bullets.  There are no reported injuries to any people, at this time.  One gun was recovered in the area.  This investigation is in the beginning phases and is not believed to be a random act. During a short foot pursuit connected to the investigation, Malcolm Whiteside attempted to pitch a handgun that was later recovered.  He was transported to the Dane County Jail.  Released 04/08/2016 at 8:55 PM by Lt.
