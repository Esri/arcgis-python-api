 A very tall robber grabbed money from the cash drawer of a Williamson St. restaurant last night. Prior to the crime, he inquired about getting some food.  A staff member told him they were closing. That is when he made a move to the cash drawer. A police dog tracked to a bike path near the Yahara River, but no suspect was located. Detectives believe the robber could be the same man who pulled off a similar crime, hours earlier, at the Open Pantry on Pflaum Rd. Released 04/07/2017 at 9:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
