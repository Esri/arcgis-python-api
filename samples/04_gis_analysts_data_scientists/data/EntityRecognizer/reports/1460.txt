At approximately 2:00 AM MPD was dispatched to multiple reports of shots being fired in and around the area of the Perkins Restaurant in the 4800 block of Hayes Rd. and E. Washington Ave. on Madison's north side.  When officers arrived they saw multiple vehicles fleeing the area and found evidence that multiple shots had been fired.  Two windows in the occupied restaurant were damaged during the shooting.  It looks as if additional rounds could have been fired from the area of the Comfort Inn and Suites across the street.  At this time no injuries have been reported.  The investigation into this incident is ongoing.
