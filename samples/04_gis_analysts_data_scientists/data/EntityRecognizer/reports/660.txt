Numerous officers were sent to help control an unruly group of teens following a Friday night football game at Mansfield Stadium, 6800 Mineral Point Rd. Officers reported several fights in the parking lot, with a large number of teens heading for other lots on nearby Odana Rd. There, officers said more than 100 teens were "screaming and yelling at one another with multiple groups starting to fight," according to one MPD report. Several young people were yelling out gang names while making direct threats to officers by stating "M-P-K" which stands for Madison Police Killers. At one point, a 15-year-old boy began to punch a girl. He was taken into custody for disorderly conduct. A crowd encircled two officers who were making the arrest "screaming different words of profanity while threatening to kill me," said one of the officers, in his report. The arrested teen continued to yell M-P-K at officers, and didn't believe he would be in the Juvenile Reception Center long: "I'll be out of here in no time," an officer quoted him as saying.    Released 09/17/2018 at 9:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
