A concerned resident called for police after seeing young men walking around in the 2600 block of E. Dayton St. Monday afternoon checking car doors of parked vehicles. The 6 suspects were also driving around in a red Toyota with Minnesota plates. The MPD located and stopped the car. It turned out to be stolen out of Chaska, MN, and it was full of electronics and other stolen items, with victims in both Minnesota and Madison. Two of the young men in the car are from our neighboring state while others are their Madison friends. The investigation is ongoing Released 09/06/2016 at 10:32 AM by PIO Joel Despain
