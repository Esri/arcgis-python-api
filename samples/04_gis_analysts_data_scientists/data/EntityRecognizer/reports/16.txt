 A 63-year-old Madison shopper was left badly shaken Thursday afternoon after a fleeing suspect attempted to get into her car as she was in the parking lot of Walmart, 7202 Watts Rd. The suspect was running from police after creating a series of disturbances in liquor departments of West Side stores. Officers were called to Walmart after he loaded four bottles of high-end liquor into a backpack and departed without paying. As the suspect was running, he forcibly grabbed the passenger side door handle of the victim's car, which was locked. He also banged on her window. She was terrified, and after he failed to get in, she told an officer she "burnt rubber" to get away. The suspect ultimately lost the chase. The arresting officer, in his report, noted: "I then had an educational conversation on the very slim likelihood of him being able to flee on foot from a patrol squad in an open parking and that in the future it would just be best for him to stop so he wouldn't be so tired when he was arrested." The arrested man could have been a bit worn out, as he told the officer he was not trying to carjack the woman. He claimed he was just trying to find a spot to sit down. Earlier in the afternoon, he created disturbances, yelling and swearing, after getting into confrontations with employees at Hy-Vee, 675 S. Whitney Way and at Copps, 620 S. Whitney Way.
