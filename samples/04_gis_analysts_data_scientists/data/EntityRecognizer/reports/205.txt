A teenage driver, who used her SUV to repeatedly ram a car full of other young people Wednesday night has been arrested for second degree reckless endangerment. West District officers spotted the suspect driving - with headlights out - as massive amounts of sparks flew from beneath the SUV. It was now operating without a right tire, and the rim was hitting the roadway as she passed right in front of the West District station. Some of the officers went to pull her over, while others responded to the corner of Raymond Rd. and McKenna Blvd. where a badly damaged and disabled car was now in the grassy median. Teens inside described how the driver of the SUV had rammed them several times, knocking them off of the road. Moments earlier the victims said they had watched as the suspect and another woman fought several blocks away, in a Raymond Rd. parking lot. They said as they left that scene, the suspect got in the SUV and began to follow them at a high rate of speed. They speculated that she might have thought they were involved in the dispute; which they claim they were not: just curious observers.    Released 01/10/2018 at 11:05 AM by PIO Joel Despain
