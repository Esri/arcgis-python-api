 Freshly fallen snow made for good tracking overnight as MPD officers - with the help of K9 Frees - were able to roundup three teenagers who had been breaking into parked cars in the North District. A Mandrake Rd. resident called for police after his car alarm went off just before midnight. Three separate sets of footprints were seen leading away from the car, and officers began following them. As they did, they noticed they went up to almost every car parked in the area. Three young men, dressed in dark clothing, were spotted in the 1500 block of Mayfield Lane. They took off running when officers ordered them to stop. The teens quickly moved through backyards, over fences, with one dropping his cell phone while trying to avoid aprehension. Frees found the phone, and the suspects ultimately gave up as the dragnet closed in on Hanover Street. One had a checkbook, and other items belonging to a 26-year-old E. Johnson St. woman who had her car and purse stolen this past Monday afternoon. The car had been recovered, but not the purse. The teen had other items possibly connected to more thefts, and the investigation continues. He was also in possession of several counterfeit $100 bills.
