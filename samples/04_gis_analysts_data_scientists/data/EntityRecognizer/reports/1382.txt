 An employee found a 57-year-old Madison man deceased inside the State Street Capitol Parking Ramp Sunday morning. The victim had walked away from a local hospital the day prior. Officers had checked his address after that but were not able to locate him. The Dane County Medical Examiner will determine the cause and manner of death. There were no signs of trauma; however, the victim was not dressed for the frigidly cold conditions. He was wearing a light jacket, a ball cap and no gloves.   Released 01/02/2018 at 10:16 AM by PIO Joel Despain
