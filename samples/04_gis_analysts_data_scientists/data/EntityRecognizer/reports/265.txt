 Madison Police responded to an armed home invasion on Morrow Court at 2:40 am.  An adult female was at home sleeping and 3 other young children were also in the residence when a side door was kicked in. Two males came into the residence armed with handguns.  The female was held at gunpoint by one suspect while the 2nd male ransacked the residence. The suspects left on foot from this location and no one was physically injured during this incident.  This was a targeted robbery and not a random event. Investigation is ongoing at this time.
