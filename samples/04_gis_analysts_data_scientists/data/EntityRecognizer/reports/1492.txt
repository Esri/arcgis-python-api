Madison Police Officers were dispatched to the 3100 block of Ashford Lane, shortly after 4am, reference a black van that was stopped in the middle of the roadway, and obstructing vehicular traffic.  The conscientious caller waited behind a nearby tree, and witnessed vehicles pulling up behind the van, to get it to move out of the roadway, by blowing horns and flashing lights with no success.  While this would have been odd at any time of the day or night, officers cautiously approached the vehicle, and located a disoriented subject inside.  The van driver, identified as Cecilio Montes-Varela, was trying to open his door for police but continued to turn the windshield wipers/headlights on/off.  The Madison Fire Department noted the vehicle's transmission was still engaged in the drive position, so they quickly placed blocks under the tires to keep the vehicle from dangerously lunging forward, reducing the potential of striking the first responders on scene. Since Montes-Varela could not get his doors/windows unlocked, the window was broken to check the driver's welfare.  Officers immediately noticed the strong smell of intoxicants inside of the vehicle, andafter field sobriety testing was completed, it made for a firm basis to arrest Montes-Varela.  Officers did located open containers of alcohol inside of the vehicle, and recovered approximately .5 gram of Cocaine as well.  Montes-Varela was conveyed to the Dane County Jail on all charges listed. PO Howard Payne  Released 03/24/2016 at 10:53 AM by P.O.
