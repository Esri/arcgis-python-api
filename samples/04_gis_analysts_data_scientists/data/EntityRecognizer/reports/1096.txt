 A 20-year-old East Towne employee contacted the MPD Tuesday wanting to report a battery that took place the night prior in the mall's parking lot. The victim said she had just left work, and was about to get into her car, when she was assaulted. She reports having her head pushed into the roof area of her car. When she turned around, she was punched in the face. The woman says she fell to the ground and that she lost consciousness for a brief time. The victim told police she was not robbed or sexually assaulted and the motive for the crime is not known. Released 09/28/2016 at 12:33 PM by PIO Joel Despain
