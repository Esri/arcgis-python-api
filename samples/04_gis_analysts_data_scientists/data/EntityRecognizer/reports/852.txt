 The MPD deployed pepper spray to break up a crowd following a large disturbance in the 600 block of University Ave. early Saturday morning. Officers observed a lot of pushing and shoving on the sidewalk with several people actively fighting in the middle of the busy thoroughfare. Three (see above) were arrested for disorderly conduct.    Released 10/23/2017 at 10:51 AM by PIO Joel Despain
