Staff members at State Street Brats thought it was a real gun, and when a man pointed the weapon at two employees, one grabbed his wrist and wrestled the weapon out of the suspect's hand. It turned out to be a very real looking BB gun. The victims said the suspect and another man were involved in some sort of dispute on a second floor landing. When they went to intervene, the suspect reached into his waistband, drew the weapon, and began pointing it. Once disarmed, he was held down by employees as police were summoned early Sunday morning. The suspect provided a couple of fake names and was finally positively identified thanks to technology at the Dane County Jail. Released 04/25/2016 at 10:38 AM by PIO Joel Despain
