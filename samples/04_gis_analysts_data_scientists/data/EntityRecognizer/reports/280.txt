 A 64-year-old Ridgeway Avenue resident took shelter in her bathroom and called 911 after hearing gunshots ring out close to her home Monday night. The woman told police she heard yelling, followed by several shots, followed by more yelling, followed by more gunfire. She thought the disturbance was coming from a nearby parking lot in the 3800 block of East Washington Ave. Officers recovered several casings from the lot. During their investigation they located a 29-year-old man who said he had been pistol whipped by a masked gunman prior to shots being fired. The victim did not contact police after the battery.    Released 04/16/2019 at 10:05 AM by PIO Joel Despain
