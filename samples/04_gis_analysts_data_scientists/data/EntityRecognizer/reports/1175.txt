 There were no reports of a shot being fired, yet a round hit a duplex on Strathmore Lane sometime in the past few days. A property manager discovered a spent bullet in the basement Monday and responding officers followed its trajectory. It appeared to have come from outside the building. It next hit a basement door, went through some stairs and drywall before coming to rest on a chair. The property manager did not believe either of the families living in the duplex would be involved in criminality and felt this was likely a random shooting. There were no reported injuries.
