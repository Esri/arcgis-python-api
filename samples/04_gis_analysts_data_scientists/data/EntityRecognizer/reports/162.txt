An Alison Lane family contacted the MPD Sunday regarding the death of their pet dog, Queen. She was an 8-month-old Pomeranian-Chihuahua mix, and was found deceased last Thursday night outside of the home. Queen had suffered head injuries and it appeared someone had intentionally harmed the small dog. She had been on a leash, tethered to the porch of her home at the time of the incident. Anyone with information on what happened to Queen is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 08/22/2016 at 10:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
