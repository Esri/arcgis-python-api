 A masked man entered L.A. Tan, 4102 Lien Rd., last evening and demanded money. No weapon was seen, but he acted like he might be armed. A clerk complied with his orders and the robber fled with cash. He was seen getting into a gold, older model Buick. Released 12/19/2017 at 8:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
