Madison police officers assigned this weekend to the downtown entertainment district arrested two individuals for disorderly conduct and battery to a police office. Early Sunday morning, July 31, 2106 at about 1:55 am officers were alerted to a fight in the 600 block of University Avenue.  As they approached, the officers observed two women in the roadway of University Avenue squaring off about to fight.  An officer reports that the he then saw each woman deliver closed fist blows to the face of the other. Officers moved in to break up the fight. One of those officers was punched in the face resulting in minor injury to the officer.  The officer reports that her assailant "squared her shoulders" and was facing the officer when she punched the officer with a closed fist.  All of the officers involved were clearly identifiable as Madison police officers by their uniforms and their repeated verbal identification and warnings to stop fighting.  The incident attracted a crowd estimated at 100 to 150 people.  Some in the crowd were reported to be "hostile" and were shouting derogatory comments about police.   Released 08/01/2016 at 10:03 AM by P.O.
