 Officers were sent to the Madison Public Library, 201 W. Mifflin St., Saturday afternoon following reports that a knife-wielding woman, with slurred speech was outside, waving the weapon around, while yelling at people in the area. When police arrived, a private security guard had gained control of the knife after the suspect dropped it. She was uncooperative and tried to bite one of the officers. "I'm drunk and I smoked crack," she stated prior to being handcuffed. Released 04/01/2019 at 12:36 PM by PIO Joel Despain
