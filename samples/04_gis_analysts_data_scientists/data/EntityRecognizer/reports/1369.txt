 Sunday night, two women were outside a residence in the 600 block of S. Baldwin St. when a knife-wielding man approached. He made threats and fled with one of the victim's messenger bag which contained her wallet. The robber was seen getting into the back of a car that quickly drove out of the neighborhood.
