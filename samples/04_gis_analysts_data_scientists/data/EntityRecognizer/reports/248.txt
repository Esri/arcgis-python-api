 When a theft suspect tried to steal a cartload of merchandise - retail value of more than $1,350 - Friday afternoon, loss prevention specialists at the Junction Rd. Target store were unable to stop her before she got in a car and fled. However, their corporate people had recently dispatched a bulletin containing the suspect's images as she has a history of similar crimes against the retailer. The bulletin was shared with a MPD officer, who closely monitors retail theft cases, and the officer immediately recognized the suspect. Officers now had a name to go with the surveillance photos, and yesterday afternoon went to the suspect's home and arrested her for felony retail theft.
