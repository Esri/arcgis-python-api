 The MPD responded to shots being fired early New Year's Day in the 1700 block of Fordem Ave. Officers saw numerous people outside of an apartment building as they arrived, and the crowd quickly dispersed. A spent bullet was recovered. A witness reported hearing three gunshots with a silver car accelerating from the area shortly thereafter. There were no immediate reports of injuries or property damage. Released 01/02/2018 at 3:26 PM by PIO Joel Despain
