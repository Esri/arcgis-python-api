 Several people were randomly shot with paintballs in the downtown area Sunday evening. The first, a 19-year-old man, was talking with friends near the corner of W. Johnson St. and Wisconsin Ave. when a car drove past. Someone inside fired a paintball and it hit victim in the head. Moments later, at the corner of W. Johnson St. and N. Lake St. two more young men were hit: one in the backpack, the other in the leg. They were able to get the plate number of the getaway car. A patrol officer spotted it near Langdon St. and pulled it over. There were five inside, all males, ranging in age from 16 to 21. There were also four paintball guns and ammunition. All in the group said they had just purchased the guns and were planning to use them at a designated paintball range; however, for some reason they decided to cruise around the Isthmus. One admitted to firing his gun at a couple of people. He was arrested. Three others were cited for unlawful possession of paintball guns. Released 04/30/2018 at 11:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
