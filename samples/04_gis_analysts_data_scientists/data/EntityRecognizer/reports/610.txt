 An Arkansas man, who is visiting Madison, said he was stabbed in the shoulder Tuesday night while walking in the 700 block of E. Gorham St. The victim told an officer he was grabbed from behind by a man dressed in dark clothing. He said the man said nothing, and that they struggled. He never saw a weapon, and it was only after the altercation that he realized he had been injured. He was treated at a hospital and released. Released 04/13/2016 at 1:43 PM by PIO Joel Despain
