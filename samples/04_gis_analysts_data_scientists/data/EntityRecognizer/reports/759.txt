 A 51-year-old Madison man told the MPD Wednesday morning that he was the victim of a robbery. The crime occurred around 10:00 p.m. Tuesday night as he sat outside in the 100 block of State St. He says a gunman, a man he has seen before, sat next to him and demanded money while pointing a small handgun. The criminal fled with the victim's cash. The victim said he did not immediately report the crime because his cell phone battery was dead. Released 08/11/2016 at 9:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
