 Two people were nearly hit by a bullet on Fish Hatchery Rd. last night. Both were inside an apartment when a round came through a door and ricocheted inside the home. The preliminary investigation indicates the shot was fired from inside a nearby apartment. This does not appear to be a targeted act of violence, but more likely negligent handling of a firearm. Officers have leads but have not located the shooter. Released 11/29/2017 at 9:10 AM by PIO Joel Despain
