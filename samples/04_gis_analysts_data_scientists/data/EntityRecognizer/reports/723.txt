 A sledgehammer-wielding teen broke a knife-waving panhandler's wrist with a sledgehammer Sunday afternoon during a faceoff in a S. Park St. parking lot. Earlier, the teen's girlfriend was planning to give the panhandler $2, but when she pulled out her money, he grabbed $4. She could see he had a knife up his sleeve and decided to leave and tell her boyfriend what happened. The boyfriend decided to grab a sledgehammer, go to the parking lot, and try to get his girlfriend's $2 back. This did not go well as the teen and the panhandler both began waving around respective weapons. Witnesses called police. They arrived to find the injured panhandler. The teen had fled prior to their arrival. The panhandler was taken to a hospital and then to jail for his part in the dispute. There is also probable cause to arrest the teen.    Released 05/21/2018 at 9:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
