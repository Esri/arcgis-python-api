A Winchester Street resident returned home from work last night to find his home had been burglarized. Four guns were stolen. Officers cleared the home, to make sure no one was still inside. Glass to a rear door had been broken, allowing an intruder access to the house. Released 10/23/2018 at 9:41 AM by PIO Joel Despain
