 A mother and daughter contacted the MPD Tuesday night after a man exposed himself to them in the parking lot of Woodman's, 3817 Milwaukee St. The victims said he was seated in a car and called them over under the pretense of asking for directions to South Towne Dr. Once they were at the car's open window, they realized the request for help was a ruse. The man was driving a silver Scion. He is described above. Released 03/10/2016 at 11:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
