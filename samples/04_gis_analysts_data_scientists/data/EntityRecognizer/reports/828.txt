Madison Police Officers were dispatched to the 2300 block of Allied Drive reference a disturbance involving an intoxicated male, banging on an apartment door and screaming.  At one point it was reported to the 911 Center that the subject was rolling around in the parking lot with no shirt or shoes on; on a night where the temperatures were hovering around 34 degrees.  Officers arrived and located Abel Campos, and while they were attempting to find out why he was acting this way, it was quickly met with obscenities and vile profanities.  Officers attempted to contact the apartment that Campos seemed to have an issue with, and as the investigation started, Campos suddenly swung at the head of one officer. The officer reacted and pushed Campos away, and he stumbled backwards before trying to assault the officer a second time in the narrow hallway.  Officers attempted to gain control of Campos, and eventually the fight went to the ground; with two different officers being kicked by him in the process.  After handcuffs were applied, leg restraints were thought to be a safe application, to keep anyone else from being injured, but that would also present a challenge as well.  Campos continued to kick and spit at officers, and a meshed spit hood had to be placed over his head to keep officers protected from the intentional projectiles. Once Campos was brought under control, one officer did have to seek medical attention at a local hospital due to a sustained knee injury.  Officers did determine that Campos had been inside an apartment where officers were dispatched, and they found overturned trash cans; connected to Campos merely getting angry.  Campos was conveyed to the Dane County Jail.
