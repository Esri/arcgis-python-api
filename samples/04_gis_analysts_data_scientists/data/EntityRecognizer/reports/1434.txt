 Two Madison teens reported being robbed at gunpoint early this morning after accepting a ride with two men they bumped into at an East Washington Ave. gas station. The victims said they were driven to the 3400 block of Graceland Ave. They were in the backseat. The two men were in the front. The teens say the men turned around, pointed guns at them, and demanded money. The teens turned over their cash and got out of the car. Detectives believe there is a connection between the teens and the men and that this was a targeted robbery. Released 08/20/2018 at 2:49 PM by PIO Joel Despain
