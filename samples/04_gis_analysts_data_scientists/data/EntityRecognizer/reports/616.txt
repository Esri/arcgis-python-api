 A downtown resident suffered two black eyes and other facial injuries after being attacked near the entryway of his apartment building early Sunday morning. The victim said a group of people were looking to get into his building when he arrived home. One person claimed to also live there, but the victim wasn't sure, and tried to pull the door shut to keep out those he did not know. He ended up getting punched and briefly knocked unconscious. He believes he was hit in the face several additional times. Central District officers are reviewing surveillance video with hopes of getting more information on the assault. The victim reported it to the MPD yesterday. Released 05/23/2018 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
