 A woman, who just moved into a Cypress Way apartment this past weekend, struggled with a stranger around midnight Sunday as the man tried to enter her building. The victim said he had approached her just as she got to an outside door. He attempted to make conversation. She tried to ignore him; got her key out and attempted to enter. He grabbed the door with one hand and her chest with the other. The victim responded by pushing the man and threatening him with pepper spray. This prompted him to take off. The victim contacted the MPD about the assault late Tuesday afternoon. Released 08/30/2017 at 9:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
