 The MPD was called to the Stoughton Police Department early Sunday morning after a 27-year-old man showed up and claimed to have been battered and stabbed in downtown Madison. The victim, who smelled strongly of alcohol, had a minor arm laceration and swelling above an eye. He could not remember much in terms of details, but said he had gone to a house party somewhere near State Street. As the gathering was breaking up, he said a group of men punched and kicked him. He later realized he also had suffered a cut to the arm during the fracas.    Released 04/15/2019 at 10:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
