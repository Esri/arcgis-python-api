 Burglars targeted tobacco products early Saturday morning during a break-in at the Stop-N-Go, 4624 Monona Dr. Police determined two subjects used a crowbar to pry open an exterior door. Once inside, they used the tool to open cupboard doors, giving them access to cigarettes and cigars. Store owners have not yet determined how many were stolen, but it was clear a large number were gone. The intruders were in and out in less than two minutes.
