 A Monroe St. resident climbed into a crashed car to provide first aid to a 70-year-old man who had just plowed through cement barriers; jumped a curb; smashed into a full bike rack; nicked the corner of an apartment building, and hit a tree. He was not injured from the crash, but was suffering from some sort of medical emergency. The man was pinned inside the car. One passerby smashed out a window, allowing the 22-year-old "first responder" to enter. She assessed the man's needs and unbuckling his seatbelt which appeared to be making it hard for him to breath. She noted no fractures, but could see the man's lips and tongue were swollen and blue. She provided comfort until paramedics arrived. As they got there, she looked at the patient and he nodded at her. The woman, who lives near the scene of the crash, told a responding police officer that she is trained in both first aid and CPR. The officer thanked her for her professionalism, thoroughness and composure. She will be nominated for a Madison Police Department citizen recognition award.   Released 09/11/2017 at 9:26 AM by PIO Joel Despain
