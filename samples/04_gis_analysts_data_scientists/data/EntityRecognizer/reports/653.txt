On 7/10/2016, an estimated 250 to 300 people gathered at the Library mall in the 700-block of State St.  This group marched up State St to the Capital building and from there to Doty St.  The group gathered on Doty St for a short time closing down the street.  MPD did divert traffic as a result.  After being asked by MPD, the group did move off the street.  This was a peaceful protest and no arrests were necessary.  MPD officers remained with the group to ensure that they could gather safely.  Released 07/10/2016 at 9:36 PM by Sgt.
