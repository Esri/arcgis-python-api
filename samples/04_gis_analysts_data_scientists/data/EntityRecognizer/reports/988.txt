 A tow truck operator was choked, but not seriously hurt early this morning as he attempted to remove a car from a parking lot on Brentwood Parkway. The victim is under contract to remove vehicles without permits. As he connected one to his truck, its owner ran out from an apartment, got in, started it up, and put the car in reverse. The tow truck operator urged the man not to do this as it would likely cause significant damage to the car which was now a couple of feet off the ground. More people arrived at the scene, with some disconnecting straps just as the operator connected them. This connection, disconnection activity went on for several minutes. The tow truck operator yelled for his assistant, who was inside the cab, to call police. Before officers arrived, a woman put the tow truck operator in a choke hold for about 30 seconds while reportedly stating: "I'm going to knock you out." The victim says the woman let him go as the MPD showed up. The car's owner was arrested for disorderly conduct; the woman for battery. Released 11/03/2017 at 10:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
