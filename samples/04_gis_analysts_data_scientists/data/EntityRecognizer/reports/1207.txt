 A stranger ran up behind two girls walking to school on Mendota St. early this morning. He bumped into one and grabbed her buttocks. The girl got out her cell phone to call police. She believes the man saw this and he scurried off. He may have gotten into a silver four-door car, possibly a Toyota. An officer gave the girl and her friend a ride to school. The MPD is sharing information with the Madison Metropolitan School District on this case. Released 10/03/2017 at 12:51 PM by PIO Joel Despain
