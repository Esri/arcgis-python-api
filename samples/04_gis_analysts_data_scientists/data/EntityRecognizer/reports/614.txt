Officers were dispatched originally for a one car crash on the westbound beltline near Gammon Rd. While officers were out of their squads, an adult female struck one of the squads causing damage. There were no injuries to any of the officers, and the adult female driver was taken to a local hospital and will be kept for observation only. She will be given a citation for inattentive driving and driving with no insurance. Released 01/28/2019 at 3:04 AM by Sgt. Ryan Gibson
