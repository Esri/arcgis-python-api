 Letting a bunch of people you do not know attend your house party can be rife with unwanted problems. Such was the case early Sunday morning following a gathering in the 200 block of S. Bassett St. The 21-year-old host estimated of the 50 to 75 people who attended his social gathering he actually knew five or 10. After all had departed his apartment, he realized his car keys were missing as was his 2009 blue Chevy Impala. It had been parked next to his home. Released 08/13/2018 at 11:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
