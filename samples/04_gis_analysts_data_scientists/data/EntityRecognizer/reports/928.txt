 A man offered three middle school students a ride to school this morning. He was in a black pickup truck, and contacted the children near the intersection of Huxley St. and Northwestern Ave. around 7:15 a.m. The man told the students it was cold and wanted to know if he could give them a lift. The students declined and hurried off to school to tell a teacher. The man is described above. The black pickup was newer and in good shape. It had no topper and possibly tinted windows.
