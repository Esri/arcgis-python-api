 A Milwaukee man and a Chicago woman were arrested Friday afternoon for stealing 90 cans of baby formula from Walmart, 4198 Nakoosa Trail. Walmart staff members placed the retail value of the stolen items at approximately $1,500. Store security said suspects put the formula in a shopping cart and covered cans with t-shirts and other merchandise before pushing the cart out without paying. Police responded. The suspects were still in the parking lot, and the baby formula was recovered from the trunk of a car in which the suspects were traveling. Released 02/20/2017 at 11:06 AM by PIO Joel Despain
