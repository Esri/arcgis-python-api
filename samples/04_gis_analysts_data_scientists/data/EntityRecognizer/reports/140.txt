 Multiple officers were called to an apartment building on N. Wickham Court Saturday night following reports of a large disturbance taking place inside. Officers learned there were ongoing tensions between residents of two apartments, and that some of this was the result of a gunshot the night prior. The weapons offense had not been reported to police, but officers now learned a round was fired in a common stairwell and the bullet entered an apartment, going through a bathroom before entering a bedroom wall. No one was hurt and investigators are attempting to sort out whether someone intentionally fired a gun, or if damage was the result of an accident or careless handling of a firearm.
