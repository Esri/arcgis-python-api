 Several MPD officers responded to the Denny's on Thierer Rd. early Saturday morning after staff members reported are large number of people milling in the parking lot with some getting ready to fight. When officers arrived they heard a gunshot. It appeared to have come from the back parking lot of nearby Motel 6, 1754 Thierer Rd. There were also many loitering at that location, and officers found a loaded handgun under a parked SUV. Several people were cited for trespassing, but it could not be immediately determined who had fired the shot or possessed the weapon. Officers did not witness any active fighting.
