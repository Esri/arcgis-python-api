 A north side resident contacted the MPD around 3:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon wanting to report a mugging that took place a few hours earlier, around noon. The victim said he was walking in the 3500 block of Packers Ave. when a group of six teens - all males - approached and knocked him to the ground. The 45-year-old said they were trying to take his wallet, but he was able to throw some punches and fight them off. They fled empty-handed. He wasn't sure he should report the crime, but family members convinced him that he should. Released 12/08/2016 at 9:39 AM by PIO Joel Despain
