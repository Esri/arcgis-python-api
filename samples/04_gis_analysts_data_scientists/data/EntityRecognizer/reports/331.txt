 A 37-year-old Madison man was mugged while walking in the 2000 block of Fisher St. Wednesday night. The victim said a car pulled up near him and the occupants - a passenger and a driver - got out. One had a handgun which was pointed at the victim's head as the robbers demanded money. They ran the victim's pockets taking his wallet and other items before driving off.
