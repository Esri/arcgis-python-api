The MPD was called to the BP gas station, 699 S. Gammon Rd., last week after a City of Madison Building Inspection employee located a skimmer inside a gas pump. This is the second time such a devise has been spotted at this location. The first was discovered by a City of Madison inspector in August. Last week's skimmer brings to six the number found recently attached to Madison pumps. Similar devices have also been recovered in many parts of Wisconsin and the MPD is assisting federal authorities in the greater investigation. Released 09/27/2016 at 12:01 PM by PIO Joel Despain
