 A 33-year-old man was taken to a hospital with a head injury after being struck in the head with a bottle. The victim said he was drinking with others beneath a Highway 30 bridge Saturday night when an argument broke out. He could not remember what it was about, but says it ended with the blow to his head. He said he assumed a fetal position, and was struck several more times. He fled the area and went to a Milwaukee St. business to call for help. The suspect has not been located. Released 03/20/2017 at 11:41 AM by PIO Joel Despain
