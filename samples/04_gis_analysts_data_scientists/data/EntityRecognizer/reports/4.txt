 A concerned passerby called for police Monday afternoon after hearing loud music coming from a car that was parked in the driveway of a N. Butler St. residence. Inside, there was a driver asleep behind the wheel, and a young child. Responding officers also recovered a loaded handgun that had been tucked between the front passenger seat and front passenger door. It had been within reach of the child. An officer gave the young boy some of her applesauce and Gatorade while having him watch Finding Dory inside her squad car. A responsible adult relative arrived to collect the child. The driver, a 26-year-old man, and the child's father, told an officer he had been drinking. He was not observed driving, and was arrested for second degree reckless endangering safety and child neglect. Released 05/02/2017 at 9:49 AM by PIO Joel Despain
