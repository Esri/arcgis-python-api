 A Menards security guard was punched multiple times as he stopped a thief outside of the company's Commerce Dr. location yesterday afternoon. The suspect, a 35-year-old Madison man, is known to the victim because of past retail thefts. The criminal had just loaded a backpack with tools and left the store when he was stopped. The victim grabbed the backpack, and that's when the suspect came at him, attempting to reclaim the bag. "Give me my s- f-er!" he said. The victim maintained custody of the bag which contained the stolen tools and items for ingesting drugs. A MPD detective spotted the getaway car on the W. Beltline Highway and attempted to pull it over. The driver sped off and the detective did not pursue because of public safety concerns and MPD policy. However, the suspect has been positively identified, and once found, he will be arrested for battery, disorderly conduct, eluding, bail jumping and possession of drug paraphernalia.
