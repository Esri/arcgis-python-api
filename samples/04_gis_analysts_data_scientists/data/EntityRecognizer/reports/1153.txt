 A con artist with an Indian accent kept a 70-year-old Madison woman on the phone for over five hours this past week as she followed directions to take out $5,000 in gift cards, and then provide PIN numbers to the thief. At the time, she thought he was Social Security investigator. He told her something about how her social security number was found in a bloody car in Texas where cocaine was also seized. Not only that, but he convinced her that her social security number was caught up in some kind of money laundering scheme to the tune of $190,000. To avoid arrest by U.S. Marshals, she needed to get the gift cards. This all felt like a scam to her, but she was fearful and followed demands. After doing as she was asked, she was led to believe a U.S. Marshal would soon be coming to her home to return her funds. When no one showed up, she called the MPD.
