Officers were sent to a hospital last night after a 55-year-old man arrived with a cut to his chest that required several sutures to close. The victim indicated he had been in downtown Madison and attempted to intervene in a fight between two men he only knows by street names. He said a third man, someone unknown to him, got involved and began making swinging motions towards the group. The victim later realized he had been injured. Officers are working to establish a location for the disturbance with hopes of securing surveillance video.   Released 04/16/2019 at 10:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
