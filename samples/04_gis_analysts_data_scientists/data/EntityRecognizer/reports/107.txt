A Middleton woman was able to safely drive her car though an intersection yesterday afternoon - against a red light - after an impaired driver slammed his car into the back of hers twice. She was stopped, and feared he was going to hit her a third time and decided it best to take evasive action by proceeding across E. Washington Ave. on S. First St. When Madison Fire Department paramedics and officers arrived the suspect was slumped over his steering wheel. Needles and other drug paraphernalia were in his car, and he admitted to being a heroin user. He did not remember either of the crashes and was arrested on tentative charges listed above. There were no injuries.  Released 01/08/2016 at 11:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
