 An aggressive robber, wearing a Deadpool or Spiderman type Halloween mask kept a hand in a pocket yesterday afternoon, making it appear he had a gun, as he held up Chase Bank, 4513 Milwaukee St. Witnesses said the man was loud and demanding as he ordered an employee to turn over cash. One customer described him as having a large belly and a "big butt." He wore a gray hooded sweatshirt, dark pants and black shoes with white trim. The masked man fled on foot with some of the bank's money. Released 12/05/2017 at 9:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
