At approximately 4:30pm, park users called because of a suspicious item near the bike path.  Officers arrived to find a homemade explosive device.  The device was a soda bottle with a mixture that when contained, builds pressure and could explode.  Dane County Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team was consulted, as was the Madison Fire Department.  If you see any such device, please do not approach it and call 911.  Madison Police ask that anyone with information contact Madison Area Crimestoppers at 608-266-6014.
