The MPD has called for OSHA investigators (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) to respond to the 1300 block of W. Badger Rd. after an employee was transported to a hospital with a life-threatening condition. The worker had been unloading a semi-truck, outside of a business, when he was found unconscious. He appeared to have become trapped between a large cart and the side of the truck. At this time, investigators are determining whether this was a work related injury or if the man suffered some sort of medical emergency. The MPD also has a detective on the scene.
