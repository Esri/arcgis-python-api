 He had a lighter in his hand, and was seated outside near a burning blanket and a 20-pound propane tank. Its valve was open. The distraught man had reportedly threatened to blow up his home Sunday night, yet the fire was closer to a neighbor's Oak Park Terrace residence than his. Officers were able to close the valve and get the lighter from the man's hand. Madison Fire also responded to Bluejay Lane and firefighters extinguished the flames. The suspect had been a domestic dispute just prior to taking a position outside of his home.   Released 08/13/2018 at 11:58 AM by PIO Joel Despain
