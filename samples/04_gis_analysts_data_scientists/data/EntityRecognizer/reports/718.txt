A couple's barking dog alerted them that an intruder had come into their Waterford Circle condo early Wednesday morning. Upon being awakened, the husband went to investigate and thought he saw a flashlight beam. He yelled out and a burglar fled. A garage door had inadvertently been left open providing the criminal access to an unlocked door into the home. Released 02/24/2017 at 10:19 AM by PIO Joel Despain
