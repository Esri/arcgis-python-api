 A DeForest man suffered non life-threatening injuries after losing control of his motorcycle while "popping wheelies" in a parking lot filled with others who were showing off cars and bikes early Sunday morning. An area along East Springs Drive is a popular hangout for "cruisers" and several witnessed the crash. The injured man told an officer he thought he hit a bump or pothole. He was admitted to a hospital with a broken arm and other injuries. The officer cited him for reckless driving. Released 06/13/2016 at 3:33 PM by PIO Joel Despain
