A Michigan man, who attempted to swindle the E. Washington Ave. AT&T store out of $3,000 worth of cell phones and services, was arrested Tuesday afternoon after employees determined his criminal intent. The suspect had presented tax identification numbers and other documentation to make it appear he was an employee of a Michigan based flooring company. AT&T staff members took the liberty of contacting the Michigan company, and it turned out no one there had ever heard of the man inside the Madison store. He was arrested on the tentative charge listed above. Released 02/17/2016 at 12:14 PM by PIO Joel Despain
