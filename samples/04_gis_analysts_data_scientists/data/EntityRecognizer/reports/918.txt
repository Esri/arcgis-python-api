 A woman armed with a handgun robbed the Chang Jiang restaurant, 4929 Commercial Ave., and detectives believe this could be her third holdup in the past day. The woman ran out with money as an employee followed her. She got to a minivan where a getaway driver - a man -pointed a gun at the victim. A MPD sergeant, on scene, said the robber also pointed her gun at the victim. There were no injuries. MPD officers and detectives are currently working all of the recent cases.   Released 09/26/2016 at 3:28 PM by PIO Joel Despain
