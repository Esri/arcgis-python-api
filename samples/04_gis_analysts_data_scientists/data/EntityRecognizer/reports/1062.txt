A mother had left her blue 2012 Chevy Equinox unlocked and running this morning as she took her child into a daycare in the 600 block of Struck St. When she got back outside, her SUV was gone. The daycare has no outside cameras, and there is no suspect information. Released 01/22/2019 at 12:25 PM by PIO Joel Despain
