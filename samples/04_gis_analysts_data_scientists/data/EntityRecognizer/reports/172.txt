 A customer chased a man out of Target, 750 Hilldale Way, after seeing him place a cell phone underneath the skirt of an unsuspecting woman Thursday afternoon. The witness believes the man took an up-skirt image of the woman, and he yelled at the man to delete whatever it was he had just recorded. The man responded by quickly leaving the store. The witness tailed him for a distance, and saw the man leave the area in a newer red pickup truck. Store surveillance video mirrored what the witness told police. West District detectives are looking to identify a person of interest. Anyone with information is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.
