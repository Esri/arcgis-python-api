A downtown resident was knocked out and robbed early this morning in the 400 block of Hawthorne Ct. after leaving a bar with four people he says he just met. One of the new acquaintances – a man - punched the victim. When the 23-year-old regained consciousness he realized his wallet and phone were gone. Released 09/22/2017 at 11:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
