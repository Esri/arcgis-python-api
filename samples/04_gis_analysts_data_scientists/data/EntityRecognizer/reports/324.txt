On 6/4/2018, Madison Police received a call, near the 2100 block of Post Road, reference an unwanted person.  When officers arrived, they began to check around the area, and noticed a subject, later identified as Morris E. Brown, located in the driver's seat of a running Chevy Impala (tan). Officers wanted to account for all individuals in and around this apartment building, and when they approached Brown, he managed to quickly roll up his car windows and exited his vehicle.  When officers asked questions as to why Brown was sitting in an idling car, he immediately advised that he wanted a lawyer, and had nothing to say. Through a variety of investigative aims, drug possession on the part of Brown was suspected. Officers continued to detain Brown until MPD K9 Allied could arrive on scene.  Once K9 Allied took a sniff of the situation, he knew that the vehicle had illegal drug substances inside, and officers would go on to locate Marijuana and individually packaged Cocaine!  Officers placed Brown under arrest, and even located more drugs inside the very hat that Brown was wearing.  Brown advised officers initially that he had nothing to say to police, but the enduring drug odors said it all.  Officers conveyed Brown to the Dane County Jail on the charge listed.     PO Howard Payne  Released 06/08/2018 at 4:00 PM by P.O.
