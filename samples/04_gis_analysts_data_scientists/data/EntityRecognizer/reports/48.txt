 A man passed a note to a cashier demanding money in a failed strong-armed robbery last night at Target, 4301 Lien Rd. The victim said the man had the hood of his sweatshirt up, and appeared to be ready to purchase items - which she scanned and bagged. When he showed the note, she asked if he was serious. He took the bagged items and left without paying, but also without any cash from the till. Released 10/28/2016 at 10:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
