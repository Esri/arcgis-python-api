A 48-year-old man suffered a broken jaw, lost two teeth, and needed 20 stitches to close a facial cut following a downtown battery last week. The victim told police he had been drinking with the suspect earlier in the day, and that the man later struck him in the face with a brick. He was unable to provide detailed information, including where the attack happened, and only knew the suspect by a street name. Officers, utilizing downtown surveillance cameras, were able to locate a crime scene in the 100 block of W. Mifflin St. and they have tentatively identified a suspect, a 47-year-old Middleton man. He has not yet been located, but MPD does have probable cause to arrest him for substantial battery. The crime was captured on camera. Released 04/02/2019 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
