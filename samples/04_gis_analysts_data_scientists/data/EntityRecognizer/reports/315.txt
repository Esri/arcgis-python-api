 She feared she would go to jail and have her visa taken away after getting a call from the "Madison Police Department." A man with a thick Indian accent told the 20-year-old victim she had tax issues and needed to pay $5,000 immediately to avoid said penalties. The Madison woman followed directions and took out $5,000 worth of gift cards from a local retailer, providing the pin numbers on the back to the "police."

The IRS issued a news release last year detailing how people can protect themselves from falling to these unscrupulous criminals. Released 08/29/2017 at 10:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
