Officers were dispatched to the 1200 block of East Washington Avenue to check on 30-year-old male who had been struck by a dark colored suv.  The victim was walking south bound on N. Baldwin Street, and was attempting to cross E. Washington Ave when a suv suddenly appeared.  The vehicle struck the victim, and the force threw the victim's body approximately 30 feet.  The suv continued westbound on E. Washington Avenue, and did not stop to ascertain if any assistance was needed by the victim.  The victim did have friends, in close proximity, who were able to call for both police and emergency medical personnel. The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital with non-life threatening injuries that spanned from his head to his feet.  A number of witnesses were interviewed about their recollection of the hit & run accident, and that information is being heavily relied upon to determine exactly what transpired.  This matter continues to be investigated, but anyone with information about this case is encouraged to contact the Madison Police Department with any details that could further the investigation. PO Howard Payne  Released 08/14/2017 at 10:15 AM by P.O.
