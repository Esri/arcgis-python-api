 A man stepped into the roadway, in front of a car, in the 400 block of W. Gilman St. Saturday night. He proceeded to drop his pants, and expose himself. He pulled the pants back up and approached the passenger side window. Inside the car were a husband and wife and their four young children. The mother - who was in the passenger seat - told the man "there are kids in here." He replied: "Good for you" and proceeded to make sexually derogatory remarks to the children. The mother announced she was calling police, and the man responded by pulling his pants down a few more times, before walking off. He was not located.
