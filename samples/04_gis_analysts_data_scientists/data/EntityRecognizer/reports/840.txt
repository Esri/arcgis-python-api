 A 10-year-old child was mugged Tuesday night while riding his bike at Aldo Leopold Park, 2906 Traceway Dr. The victim said some older boys approached him; two held his arms while a third punched him and ran his pockets. The primary suspect - age 13 - took the child's money and the teens fled. The MPD has identified the primary suspect and he was arrested last night on a tentative charge of robbery with the use of force. Another involved teen – a 15-year-old - has also been identified but not yet arrested. The victim said he did not know the older boys. Released 06/29/2017 at 10:43 AM by PIO Joel Despain
