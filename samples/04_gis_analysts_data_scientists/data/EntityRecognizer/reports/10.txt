 The MPD is seeking help locating a unique $1,500 bicycle that was stolen from outside of a Union St. home after a thief cut a bike lock. The Extreme Fat Tire E-Grizzly utilizes a battery pack which makes for easier peddling. Its owner had removed the battery pack and taken it inside Monday. The bike was stolen that night. Anyone with information should contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 08/17/2016 at 11:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
