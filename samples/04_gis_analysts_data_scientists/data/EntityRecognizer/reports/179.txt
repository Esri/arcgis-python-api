 An off-duty employee of a downtown tavern said a boisterous customer threatened him with a sheathed knife Monday night after the victim told the suspect and his friends to tone down their loud conversation. The victim called 911 and the suspect was contacted as he walked away from the victim's workplace: the Wisconsin Brewing Tap Haus, 107 State St. The suspect did have a nine-inch knife in his pocket but he denied pulling it out while in the bar. He was arrested for disorderly conduct while armed. Released 02/20/2018 at 9:32 AM by PIO Joel Despain
