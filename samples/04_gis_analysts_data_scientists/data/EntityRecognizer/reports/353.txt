 One bullet hit an unoccupied bedroom of a Judy Lane home Saturday night as multiple rounds were fired from a car that had driven into the area Saturday night. Many called 911 after hearing the series of reports. A six-year-old boy was sleeping in another bedroom of the house that was damaged. His grandparents were also home, but not injured. A witness reported seeing a car, with its lights out, pull in front of the targeted residence just before gunshots rang out. Released 12/26/2017 at 9:58 AM by PIO Joel Despain
