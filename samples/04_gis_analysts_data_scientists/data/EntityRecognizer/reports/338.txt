While he was being booked into jail early this morning, an arrested man repeatedly used racial slurs, threatening to kill a black Madison Police officer. "Kill the n-" and "I kill n for life" were among the epithets being yelled out as the suspect motioned toward the black officer. The MPD had just arrested the man inside a downtown bar after he sent two patrons - both women - into a panic. He had told them his son had just died, that he had a gun in his pocket, and he was about to kill himself. "Can I tell you something?" "I lost my son today," the man was quoted as saying before telling the women about the weapon. "Guess what I have in my pocket," he said. They tried to talk him out of hurting himself, but he asserted it was "the only answer" and "what he had to do."   A call was placed to 911. Arriving officers determined the man did not have a gun and did not have a son who had just died. He was arrested for threatening a police officer with a hate crime enhancer, disorderly conduct and bail jumping. Released 09/14/2018 at 9:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
