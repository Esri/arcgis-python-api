She was thankful three young people were not more seriously injured or killed, but in tears she told a Madison officer just how much a Saturday night crash was going to set her life back. The 50-year-old Madison mother has disabilities that make it difficult for her to walk. But soon she was to move her family into a perfect home – at least for her needs. It's on Dunns Marsh Terrace. It is under construction and owned by the City of Madison. Now it is believed to be structurally unstable after the young suspects slammed a SUV into it. All were injured and taken to hospitals. The 2017 Subaru Forester, in which they were joyriding, had been stolen last Thursday morning after its owner – who was just hoping to warm the SUV up - left it unlocked, unoccupied, and running on Grand View Blvd.   Fitchburg Police had attempted to stop the SUV Saturday, but the teens sped off and crashed into the victim's soon-to-be home. As it is under construction, no one was inside at the time of the collision. Fitchburg Police are handling tentative charges against the suspects. Two of three are part of a Madison based gang that has garnered recent news coverage following a rash of crimes that include car thefts. Released 11/19/2018 at 1:20 PM by PIO Joel Despain
