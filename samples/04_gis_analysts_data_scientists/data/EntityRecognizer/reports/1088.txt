Officers were called to the 2500 block of Monterey Dr. for a man trying to take a vehicle by threatening the driver with a handgun. Officers were on scene quickly and were informed the suspect, Kevin Lockhart, had fled to a nearby apartment building. Officers determined Lockhart was likely still inside the building based on witnesses on scene. Officers evacuated the first floor of the building and started giving verbal commands to the apartment identified by witnesses. Lockhart did eventually cooperate with police and was taken into custody. A handgun similar to that used by the Lockhart was also recovered by officers in the building. The victim was unharmed.
