Utilizing video from city surveillance cameras, downtown officers were able to identify and arrest a substantial battery suspect last night. Melvin F. Bogus, age 39, Madison, is accused of punching a homeless man in the head early Monday morning. The blow toppled the victim rendering him unconscious. He was taken to a hospital where he needed multiple stitches to close a head cut. The suspect claimed the victim was injured during mutual combat, but officers told him surveillance video did not support that assertion.   Released 10/23/2018 at 10:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
