 A 24-year-old Madison man believes he was likely pistol whipped by an acquaintance who had pointed a handgun at his head during a botched armed robbery early Sunday morning. The victim said he and the suspect bumped into one another in the parking lot of Woodman's, 3817 Milwaukee St. The victim said the suspect got into his SUV to talk, but then pulled a weapon and demanded money. The injured man said he was struck in the head by an object as he jumped from the driver's seat. He suffered a cut and called police. The suspect, who fled empty-handed, has not been located.
