 A delivery driver left his car running and unlocked early Sunday morning as he took food to an address on E. Johnson St. As he was getting back to his car, he saw a stranger get in and drive off. As the MPD was taking his theft report, Monona Police reported the stolen car had just crashed in the 6100 block of Monona Dr. They apprehended the suspect for the crash, and the MPD developed probable cause to arrest him for operating a motor vehicle without owner's consent. The victim got his cell phone and wallet back, but his car had to be towed away, having been significantly damaged. Released 11/12/2018 at 3:07 PM by PIO Joel Despain
