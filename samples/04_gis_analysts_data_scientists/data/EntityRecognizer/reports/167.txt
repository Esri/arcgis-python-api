 A Madison man was swindled out of nearly $6,000 after believing he owed the IRS a lot of cash after being told he had "misfiled" his taxes. A caller from the "IRS's major case section" claimed the 32-year-old had been sent several forms notifying him of the problem, including a CP11A: a final warning order. The kindly "IRS" folks did let him know that they had checked his background and determined he was an "upstanding person." Do to this status he was given the opportunity to make things right with the "IRS" by traveling to several businesses where he could buy iTunes cards and provide the "IRS" with their numbers. One "agent" stayed on the phone with the victim while he followed through with instructions, letting him know he was being recorded for "evidence purposes." If he failed to immediately adhere to orders, local police would arrest him. By the time he called the MPD, after realizing he had been duped, he had made three Itunes' cards purchases: two for $2000 and a third for $1,998. Released 06/23/2017 at 10:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
