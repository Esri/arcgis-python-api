A bicyclist said a bowman pointed an arrow at her last evening while she was traveling on the Southwest Commuter Path near N. Orchard St. The 19-year-old told officers she had to hit the brakes as the man cut in front of her. He was pale, dressed in black and carrying a bow and arrow. The teen said the man pulled the string back as he pointed toward her. She screamed and peddled away. Responding officers could not find an archer or anyone else who had seen one. A review of area surveillance video also did not reveal any useful images. Released 12/05/2018 at 10:41 AM by PIO Joel Despain
