 A man who had been following woman he does not know, calling her derogatory names, was arrested for a downtown battery early this morning after he punched the woman and attacked the man with whom she was walking. The assault took place in the 500 block of University Ave. Both victims had told the suspect to stop the insults and to quit following them. The suspect responded by repeatedly punching the male victim. The woman tried to intervene and that is when she was slugged in the mouth. Police were called and the suspect, who was still in the area, was arrested. He denied wrongdoing. Released 08/29/2017 at 10:33 AM by PIO Joel Despain
