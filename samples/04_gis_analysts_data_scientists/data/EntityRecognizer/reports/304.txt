On 11/14/2018, shortly after 11:23pm, officers responded to the 1000 block of Williamson Street, reference a loud music complaint.  Officers stated, with closed windows on their squad cars and from a significant distance, you could clearly hear the elevated music levels.  This particular address was a familiar location, and officers gained entry into the residence to deal with John Henry Reighn; a person who had been warned about excessively loud music in the past.  Officers attempted to yell over the music, due to the volume, but Reighn turned the music down briefly to explain that God told him to play the music at the elevated levels, and he was going to continue to do just that.  Officers did attempt to plea to Reighn's sense of compromise, but that resulted in his returning to music source, and turning the music up even higher than it was before officers arrived.  The officers tried to advise Reighn that if he complied, he would only receive a citation.  The strong smell of alcohol may have played a significant role in the decisions that Reighn made, and it inevitably led to his being taken into custody.  Reighn became increasingly agitated and uncooperative, while being conveyed to the Dane County Jail; where the booking process was attempted.  PO Howard Payne  Released 11/15/2018 at 2:53 PM by P.O.
