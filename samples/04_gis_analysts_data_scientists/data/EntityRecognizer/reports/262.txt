 A N. Frances St. resident was working on his computer last night when he heard voices coming from outside of his bedroom window. He got up from his desk to investigate, and found a burglar about to get inside his apartment. The stranger's torso was inside his bedroom window. The criminal quickly pulled out and took off, having been confronted. A window screen was found to have been cut. The victim believes the intruder was likely working in concert with someone else as he could hear at least two voices just prior to the attempted entry.
