A Frisch Rd. homeowner got up to use the bathroom early this morning and thought it best to call police after spotting a SUV in the middle of his front lawn. It was running. A driver was behind the wheel, but asleep and snoring loudly. Officers responded, and before waking the man, they put the SUV in park and removed keys from the ignition. The driver, having been aroused from slumber, announced he was on his way home. He was arrested for his fourth offense of drunken driving. Released 09/25/2017 at 11:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
