A City of Madison inspector discovered a credit card skimmer attached to the internal workings of a University Ave. gas pump yesterday. He was conducting random inspections when he made the finding on pump five at Genin's Mobil. The skimmer was seized by the MPD and turned over to the FBI. Employees at the gas station told an officer they last checked pumps last Friday, and there were no skimmers at that time. This is the latest in a string of similar fraud cases that have targeted Madison and many other Wisconsin communities.. Released 11/16/2016 at 11:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
