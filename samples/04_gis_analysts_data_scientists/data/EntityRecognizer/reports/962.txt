An 83-year-old victim told a responding officer Sunday afternoon that she is feisty and tough, and she was not about to let a would-be strong-armed robber get her purse. She had just finished shopping at the Hy-Vee, 3801 E. Washington Ave., when a woman with two-tone blonde and black hair came up from behind. The stranger punched the older woman in the head and grabbed a hold of her purse strap. The two grappled for control with the octogenarian delivering a punch of her own to the victim's face. By this time the commotion had attracted the attention of other shoppers, and several came to the victim's aid while also chasing the criminal away. The victim - who kept her purse - suffered a couple of wrist cuts, from the suspect digging in her nails, and she was beginning to develop a knot on her head as she spoke with police. The MPD, utilizing surveillance images, has identified a suspect. She remains at large. Released 09/07/2016 at 11:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
