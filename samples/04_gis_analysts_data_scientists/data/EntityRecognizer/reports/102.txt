A concerned neighbor contacted a property owner when he saw a group of teens breaking into the property owner's currently vacant Theresa Terrace home Saturday afternoon. The victim called the MPD and officers arrived to find five teens inside the house. One told an arresting officer that the group was looking for a place to smoke marijuana. Several window screens were damaged and entry was made through a window. The teens were taken to the Juvenile Reception Center on tentative charges of burglary and criminal damage to property.  Released 09/17/2018 at 10:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
