A cab driver was robbed at gunpoint of his money and cell phone after being dispatched to West Shore Dr. early this morning. The victim said two men flagged him down and got into his car. As they did, his driver's side door opened and a gunman pointed the weapon at his head. All three men fled on foot toward Brittingham Park. Besides his property, they also grabbed the cab's receipt printer. It was later found in the street by investigating officers. Released 12/14/2018 at 10:05 AM by PIO Joel Despain
