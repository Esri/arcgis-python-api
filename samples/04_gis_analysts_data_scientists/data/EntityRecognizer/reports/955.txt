Police were called to James Madison Park, reference two individuals fornicating in and around a nearby vehicle.  Concerned citizens, containing large numbers of children, reported to police that disturbing activities had been ongoing in broad daylight!  It was approximately 7:33pm, and one witness described a male and female, later identified as Darryl Pierce & Brenda Owen, disrobing each other in front of an on looking crowd, and seemed to have no concerns about being video recorded by nearby cell phones. The activities that were described to police definitely carried a NC-17 movie rating (if not higher), and witnesses did note exposed body parts inside the tan Honda sedan.  The sexual interactions between Pierce and Owen disturbed a number of families, as many were planning on having a good time in the park, but ended up with memories that may not soon fade away.  When officers arrived on scene and witnessed the activity first hand, they had no other option but to take both Pierce & Owen into custody on charges listed above. People need to realized that community parks in Madison are wonderful spaces to be utilized by all, but everyone needs to be respectful of others, and not be involved in activities that are inappropriate for public observation.
