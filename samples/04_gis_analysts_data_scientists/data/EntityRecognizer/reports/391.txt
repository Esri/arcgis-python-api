A 42-year-old man showed up at a Madison Hospital with a minor gunshot wound around 6:00 a.m. He never called police, but officers were dispatched to the hospital after he arrived with a graze wound to the head which required stitches. The man told police he was injured inside his McKenna Blvd. home around 3:40 a.m. Detectives are investigating, but do not believe there is a general danger to the community, saying that whatever happened, this was a targeted act of gun violence.
