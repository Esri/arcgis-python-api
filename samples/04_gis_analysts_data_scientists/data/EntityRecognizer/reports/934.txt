On November 14th, 2018, shortly after 3pm, an officer happened to be driving in the 500 block of State Street, and noticed a subject he had past interactions with; also noting that Matthew Knutowski had an outstanding warrant.  The officer exited his squad, approached Knutowski, and communicated that he had no other alternative but to place him under arrest for the outstanding Rock County warrant.  An additional officer was also standing by, and a seemingly cooperative Knutowski found his arms being placed behind his back; for the purpose of handcuffing.  Knutowski had a different idea, as to what should happen next. The officers were met with Knutowski's hands/arms being pulled away from the handcuffs, and he then attempted to run away.  One officer grasped the leather jacket that Knutowski was wearing, and that provided a firm and solid item to reign him in and back towards the officers; eventually falling to the ground.  Once officers got Knutowski in handcuffs, he proceeded to bang his head against the hood of the police car.  Fortunately, no one was injured in this scenario.  Knutowski was conveyed to the Dane County Jail on all charges listed.  PO Howard Payne    Released 11/16/2018 at 2:40 PM by P.O.
