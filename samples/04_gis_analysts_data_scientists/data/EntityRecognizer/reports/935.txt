 A 61-year-old Madison man was tackled and repeatedly punched in the head last night after going into a bathroom at the Madison Public Library - Goodman South Madison, 2222 S. Park St. When library staff members found the victim, his eyes were nearly swollen shut and he had a baseball-sized knot on the back of his head. He was taken to a hospital for stitches. The victim says he has been in a past confrontation with the suspect, but was unable to remember the man's name. The MPD is in the process of trying to identify his assailant.
