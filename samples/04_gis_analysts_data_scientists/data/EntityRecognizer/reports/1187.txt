The MPD responded to three separate traffic situations yesterday involving drivers suspected of operating under the influence of narcotics. A 26-year-old Pardeeville man was cited for numerous violations, including operating while under the influence of a controlled substance, after he drove into a parked car at N. Baldwin St. and Sherman Ave. around 6:40 p.m. He had a baggie in his pocket containing a substance he first thought to be heroin. It turned out to be Fentanyl. A little after 2:00 p.m., a 26-year-old Madison driver was arrested for operating while under the influence after he nodded off at the wheel, and then drove over a median at the intersection of Packers Ave. and International Lane. Drug paraphernalia commonly used to ingest opioids was found in the car.   An hour earlier, a 28-year-old Madison man was cited for his second offense of operating under the influence after he nodded off behind the wheel while at a red light. Another driver honked a couple of times to try to get the him going. This was at N. Stoughton Rd. and Commercial Ave. The suspect hit the gas, went over a median and across three lanes of oncoming traffic.   Released 01/23/2018 at 11:00 AM by PIO Joel Despain
