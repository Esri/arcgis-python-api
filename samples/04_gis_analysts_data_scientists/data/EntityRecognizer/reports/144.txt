 The MPD was called to the Lien Rd. Target Sunday night after a man exposed himself to women shopping at the store. The suspect was still inside when officers arrived but fled on foot, in an attempt to avoid capture. Officers - with help from a Maple Bluff Police Department K9 - set up a perimeter. The suspect was found hiding behind a dumpster on East Towne Way.  Released 10/22/2018 at 10:32 AM by PIO Joel Despain
