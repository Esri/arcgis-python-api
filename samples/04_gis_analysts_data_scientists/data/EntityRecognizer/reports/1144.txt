 Employees from St. Mary's Care Center, 3401 Maple Grove Dr., called for police Sunday afternoon after seeing a young man in the parking lot checking for unlocked car doors. Responding officers spotted the teen driving a car that had been reported as stolen out of Fitchburg. Madison was in the throes of a winter storm and the unlicensed driver showed very poor operational skills: speeding, fish-tailing, blowing a stop sign before losing control and hitting a curb on Tottenham Rd. The MPD did not chase the suspect while he was behind the wheel, but did pursue him once he was on foot as he ran from the stolen car. He made it over a few fences and through some backyards before getting caught. Released 02/05/2018 at 11:01 AM by PIO Joel Despain
