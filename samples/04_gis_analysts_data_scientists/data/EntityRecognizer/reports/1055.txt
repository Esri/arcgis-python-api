Shortly after 12:15 pm, a concerned citizen observed a white van slowly decelerate and roll up onto a curb, near the intersection of Barton Road & Gilbert Road.  The complainant thought something was seriously wrong when both the horn and alarm system engaged, but there was visibly an unresponsive male subject inside of the van.  Emergency medical personnel from the Madison Fire Department arrived on scene, and immediately started to assess the driver's condition, who was later identified as Marcin Staszak Jr. Officers conducted a variety of tests, and after locating Heroin inside of the vehicle, deduced that there was a definite correlation to items located and the earlier described driving behavior.  Staszak Jr. was taken into custody on all charges listed above.  Staszak Jr. has been the focal point of four other intoxicated driver charges/cases in the past.  No one was injured in this case.  PO Howard Payne   Released 08/17/2017 at 1:52 PM by P.O.
