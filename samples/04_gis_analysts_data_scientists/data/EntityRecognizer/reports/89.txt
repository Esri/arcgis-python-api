 Two phony $100 bills were successfully passed at Madison bars this week. Both look kind of real but are clearly marked with "FOR MOTION PICTURE USE ONLY." The first one was presented at Busse's Markway Tavern, 2005 N. Sherman Ave., around 11:40 p.m. Tuesday night. The criminal bought one drink and pocketed the change. A similarly described man entered the Echo Tap, 554 W. Main St., just over an hour later and bought a $5 drink with a look-alike hundred. In both cases, the criminal left in a red or maroon van.   Released 09/15/2017 at 10:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
