The MPD was very pleased with how well Freakfest went this year. A crowd of around 30,000 was on hand, and there were no serious incidents reported during the course of the event. By 1:00 a.m. there had been 13 arrests, mostly citations, and only one person went to jail. The MPD would like to thank our law enforcement partners for helping keep the peace: Dane County Sheriff, Middleton Police, Fitchburg Police, Capitol Police, UW Police and the Wisconsin State Patrol. We would also like to thank attendees for making Freakfest 2016 another positive community Halloween celebration.    Released 10/30/2016 at 2:05 AM by PIO Joel Despain
