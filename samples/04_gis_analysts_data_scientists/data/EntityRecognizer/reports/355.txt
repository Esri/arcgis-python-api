 Many Troy Drive homeowners contacted 911 after hearing a volley of gunshots in the 300 block Friday night. Responding officers found seven shell casings, in two groupings: some west of Main Dr. on Troy Dr.; some east of Main Dr. on Troy Dr. Witnesses reported hearing a woman scream and a car accelerate around the time of the gunfire. There were no reports of injuries or property damage, but many living in the area were left with significant safety concerns. Released 05/07/2018 at 10:04 AM by PIO Joel Despain
