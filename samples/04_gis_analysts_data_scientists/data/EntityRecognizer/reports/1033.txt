 A crime victim and his neighbor - who came out of his residence with a handgun - detained a suspect early this morning as police responded to a report of someone breaking into cars in the 3100 block of Dorchester Way. The area has seen a rash of theft from autos with Madison Crime Analysts identifying 22 similar cases in the month of June alone. Around 4:20 a.m., the victim heard his car alarm go off, and looked out to see the suspect inside his vehicle. He went outside, clad in boxer shorts, as the suspect fled. The foot chase ended with the victim tackling the suspect in the grassy median of McKee Rd. He put him in a bear hug and asked a passerby to call police. Around the same time, the victim's neighbor - who had also heard the alarm and became aware of what was transpiring - armed himself and went to where the victim was holding the suspect. The neighbor did not point the firearm, but ordered the suspect to stay put while police responded. The 16-year-old provided a name officers could not verify and claimed to be from Chicago. He said he just happened to be walking in the neighborhood and denied committing any crimes. Released 06/30/2016 at 1:01 PM by PIO Joel Despain
