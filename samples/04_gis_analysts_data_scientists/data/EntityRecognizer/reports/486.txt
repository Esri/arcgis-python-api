 Four armed men - three with handguns, one with a shotgun - robbed a man and woman inside their Dutch Mill Road home Sunday night. The intruders demanded drugs, guns and money. They fled with cash and a cell phone. Detectives believe the victims were specifically targeted. The criminals drove off in a dark sedan with tinted windows.
