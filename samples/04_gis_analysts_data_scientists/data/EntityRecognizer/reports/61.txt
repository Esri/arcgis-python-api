 The MPD nabbed a young car thief Wednesday afternoon after pickup truck was stolen from a lot near the Dane County Regional Airport, 4000 International Lane. Its owner had left it unlocked with a spare key inside. A Dane County Sheriff's deputy attempted to stop the truck, which was occupied by two teens. The driver was so short he could barely be seen over the steering wheel. The joyriders did not stop, but did dump the truck on Windom Way. They ran. MPD officers were in the area on an unrelated call and the 13-year-old driver's flight path took him right into one. He was arrested, but the accomplice got away.
