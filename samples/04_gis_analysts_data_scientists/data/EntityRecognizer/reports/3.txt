 Doctors believe a homeless man likely suffered multiple facial fractures following a battery on Parkside Dr. early Sunday morning. The victim said he climbed into an unlocked truck that was in a parking lot. He went to sleep, and was later awakened by a man who pulled him from the truck and repeatedly punched him in the head. The 63-year-old walked to a nearby business and police were called. He was unable to provide a detailed description of his assailant. Released 05/07/2018 at 10:10 AM by PIO Joel Despain
