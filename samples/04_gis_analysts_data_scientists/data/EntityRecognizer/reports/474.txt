 An upskirting case that began early last month culminated with the arrest of a 21-year-old Madison man yesterday. On June 2nd the MPD was called to Target, 750 Hilldale Way, for a report of a man who had used his cell phone camera to capture images of a skirt clad shopper. Using surveillance images and store receipts, the MPD was able to identify a suspect. His phone was legally seized and searched by an investigator from the MPD's Forensic Services Unit. It was determined the phone contained not only upskirt images but child pornography which had been downloaded from external sources. The suspect was taken into custody on tentative charges listed above. Released 07/06/2017 at 10:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
