 The Burglary Crime Unit arrested a Madison teen this week following an investigation into a home burglary that took place in late October. The victim and his son had taken their dog for a 15-minute walk on the afternoon of the 27th, and left the garage door open while they were out. Someone entered and took some of the victim's tools. Knowing that crooks sometimes immediately try to pawn stolen items, the victim went to Pawn America and found the suspect and an accomplice with his property. He got it back as they fled.     Released 12/22/2017 at 11:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
