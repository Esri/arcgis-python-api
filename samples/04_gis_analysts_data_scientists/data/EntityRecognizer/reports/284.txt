     Two neighbors ended up being arrested Wednesday night following a disturbance that included a 40-year-old man punching a 14-year-old boy in the face. This led to the boy's relative, a 15-year-old girl, striking the man in the head several times with a frying pan, causing a cut which required stitches.     The remorseful man told police the situation started in his basement. He routinely allows neighborhood children to come over and use his television and gaming equipment. He became angry when the 14-year-old victim apparently got ahold of his credit card in order purchase video game content.  When the man received a notice of the transaction on his cell phone, he went to the basement to confront the child. He said he meant to strike the boy in the chest, but ended up punching him in the face. The man said he told the teen he was sorry as the victim fled the home. He went to his residence and told members of his family what happened, and this is when the 15-year-old girl went over to the neighbor's home and battered him with his own frying pan.     She was arrested for substantial battery. He was taken into custody on a tentative charge of physical abuse of a child.  Released 03/14/2019 at 9:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
