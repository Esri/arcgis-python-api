 A drunken driver was arrested last night after he fled the scene of a crash at Seminole Highway and Mohawk Dr. A witness said the suspect blew a stop sign on Mohawk Dr. and smashed his car into one driven by a 30-year-old Madison woman as she headed north on Seminole Highway. The victim suffered bumps and bruises. The suspect took off on foot, running toward the W. Beltline Highway. Responding officers spotted him on a pedestrian bridge over the busy thoroughfare, and took him into custody. Prior to the hit-and-run, the MPD had attempted to stop the driver in the 4600 block of Verona Rd. as he was wanted on a felony warrant. The suspect sped off, and the MPD did not chase him as officers did not want to put anyone at risk. Despite their caution, the suspect still endangered the lives of others.
