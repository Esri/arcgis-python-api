 A 25-year-old Madison man said he encountered a gunman in the parking lot of an apartment complex on Morraine View Dr. this morning. The stranger demanded the victim turn over his money and shoes. Just as this was happening, a car pulled into the lot, distracting the would-be robber. The victim fled before giving up any possessions. Released 11/07/2016 at 3:17 PM by PIO Joel Despain
