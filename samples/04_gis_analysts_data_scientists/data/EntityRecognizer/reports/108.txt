 A nine-year-old Chavez Elementary student sprinted to her house Wednesday afternoon after two men in a white van contacted her as she walked home from school. The child said she was near the intersection of Golden Copper Lane and Mader Dr. when one of the men tried to get her to come to the van. Frightened, she ran. She believes the van was following her, so she took to some backyards to get home. She says the men were both white, with one appearing to be in his 20's and the other appearing to be in his 40's. She said both looked "dirty." The student said it was a cargo van with no rear windows, and some scratches. Again, she said it was white in color. The MPD is working with the Madison Metropolitan School District in sharing information on the case. Released 09/28/2017 at 10:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
