 A knife-wielding woman claimed the man she tried to stab had come at her first early Sunday morning outside of Capitol Centre Market, 111 N. Broom St. However, video evidence recorded it differently and she was arrested for second degree reckless endangerment. Responding officers recovered nine-inch steak knife. On the video, the woman can be seen raising it above her head and slashing downward towards the victim four to five times. He protects himself by backing up. It appears he came within about a foot of being stabbed. The suspect and victim are acquainted with one another. Released 09/04/2018 at 11:08 AM by PIO Joel Despain
