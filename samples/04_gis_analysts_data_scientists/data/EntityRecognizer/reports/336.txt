 The MPD responded to a burglary alarm early Sunday morning at Steve's Liquor, 122 Junction Rd. A glass door was found to have been shattered by a rock. Surveillance video shows two people to be involved. Both carried duffle bags, with one acting as a lookout, as the other ventured into the store. This person likely triggered an audible motion alarm. The sound appears to have scared the burglars off nearly empty-handed. One did grab a bottle of alcohol before both scurried off. Released 10/23/2017 at 10:24 AM by PIO Joel Despain
