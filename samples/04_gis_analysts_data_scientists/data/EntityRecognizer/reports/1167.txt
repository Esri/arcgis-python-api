 Employees at Burnie's Rock Shop, 901 E. Johnson St., estimate a burglar got away with tens of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise during a weekend break-in. The MPD was called to an alarm around 1:15 a.m. Sunday. Officers found a window to the business shattered as well as glass to a display case. A concrete landscaping brick was found inside, as was blood, and it appears the crook was injured during the commission of the crime. Anyone with information is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014. Released 01/29/2018 at 10:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
