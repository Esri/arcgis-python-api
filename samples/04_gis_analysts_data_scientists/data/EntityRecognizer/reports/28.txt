 A man with a head wound showed up at the MPD's South District around 8:45 p.m. last night. The 27-year-old told officers he was shot at while pulling into a BP gas station, 4501 Verona Rd. There was a hole in his rear car window that could have been caused by a bullet. It was not clear if flying glass, a bullet fragment, or something else caused his cut. He was taken to a hospital for treatment. The victim told police a man in another car had shot at him. Detectives believe he was specifically targeted and that this was not a random act of violence.
