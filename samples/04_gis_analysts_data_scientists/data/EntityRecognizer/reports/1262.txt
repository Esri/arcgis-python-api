 An armed robber put a handgun to the back of a 14-year-old customer last night and kept the boy in front of him as he moved toward the counter of Kwik Trip, 2601 Fish Hatchery Rd. Continuing to use the child as a buffer, the gunman next positioned his weapon under the boy's arm and now pointed it at a clerk. He demanded and received cash from the till and fled on foot. The teenager told police he was "terrified" as the armed man "coulda shot me." A police dog was unable to track down a suspect. Released 12/05/2017 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
