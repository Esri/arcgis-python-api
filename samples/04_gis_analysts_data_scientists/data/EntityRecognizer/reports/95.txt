 A motorist was shot at this morning while driving on Packers Ave., near International Lane. The 59-yar-old victim said a black Chevrolet Impala began driving next to his car. He saw the driver's side rear passenger window roll down from which a gunman pointed a handgun in his direction. Fearful, he sped up and heard three "pops." His rear windshield shattered and he pulled over to call police. The victim was not physically injured, and it's not known why someone would want to shoot at him.
