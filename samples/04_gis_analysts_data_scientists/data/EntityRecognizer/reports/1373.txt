 A woman walking in the 600 block of E. Gorham St. was mugged Sunday night. The victim said two men approached from behind, with one ripping her purse strap from her shoulder. This caused the 29-year-old to fall to the ground. While down, one robber punched the victim several times in the face. She got up, and gave chase as the men fled. They got into a car parked nearby. It was being driven by a woman, and she now had the victim's purse. The victim was able to reach in and grab it back; however, her cell phone and wallet were gone. When police arrived, the victim was crying, bleeding from the knee, and in pain. An officer allowed the victim to use his squad car computer to successfully track the stolen phone. It turned out a concerned citizen had just found it - and the wallet. Fleeing criminals had evidently tossed both, and the victim quickly got them back. She described the getaway car, used by the robbers, as an older four-door Honda with tinted windows. Released 08/29/2017 at 10:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
