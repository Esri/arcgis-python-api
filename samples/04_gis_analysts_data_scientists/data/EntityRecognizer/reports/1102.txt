 A Madison cab driver was injured, but his passenger was not, following a drunken driving crash on W. Dayton St. early Saturday morning. The suspect, an intoxicated 23-year-old Madison man, had run a red light and drove from the scene in a heavily damaged car after colliding with the taxi. His vehicle was now without its front bumper, and a MPD officer was able to tentatively identify the suspect by running the license plate that was left behind. A Dane County Sheriff's deputy spotted the hit-and-run driver on Campus Drive and University Ave. He was pulled over and arrested. The 55-year-old cab driver suffered a head cut and other injuries. He was treated at a hospital. Released 04/24/2017 at 10:14 AM by PIO Joel Despain
