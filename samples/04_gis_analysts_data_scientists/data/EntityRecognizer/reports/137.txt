 A downtown resident was scammed out of $3,000 this week after falling for an "IRS" scheme. This is the one where victims are told they owe money to the government, and if they don't pay up immediately, they will be arrested. In this latest case, the 19-year-old victim got a call from a number that appeared to be the MPD's non-emergency line. He ended up talking with several people, all of whom claimed to be IRS officials. He was told he needed to pay nearly $6,000. He said he only had $3,000. He was directed to purchase Target gift cards in that amount and to supply card numbers to the callers. He did all of this, and then found out he had been ripped off.
