 A drunken hit-and-run driver was arrested Thursday night thanks to assistance from an eyewitness and a trail of motor fluid that led from the West Beltline Frontage Road crash site to the suspect's Ardsley Circle apartment. The witness saw the car exit the West Beltline near Curry Parkway at a high rate of speed. It left the roadway, took down a large traffic sign and its driver never stopped. The witness followed the car while contacting 911. He showed responding officers the trail of motor fluid. It led them to the damaged car which had two completely flat front tires. The driver was located and arrested on tentative charges listed above. Released 11/18/2016 at 10:41 AM by PIO Joel Despain
