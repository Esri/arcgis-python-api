 A MPD officer activated his squad car lights hoping to get the attention of a driver who was coming directly at him early this morning on E. Gorham St. The approaching motorist was going the wrong way on the one-way street, and did not seem to notice the squad car lights. It would have been a head-on collision save for the fact the officer made a last second evasive maneuver. It did not stop the crash, as the woman's car struck the squad's driver's side wheel well area while going approximately 15 mph. The intoxicated woman - a 23-year-old Madison woman - was cited for first offense drunken driving, driving against traffic, and running a red light. There were no injuries.
