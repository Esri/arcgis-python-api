A Jaguar, valued at $100,000 has been recovered following a burglary that occurred around 2:30 a.m. on Trappers Trail. The homeowner reported the Jaguar and a Range Rover, also valued at $100,000, were both stolen. He believes the garage door was left unlocked and said keys for both vehicles had been in the garage. He awoke to the sounds of an alarm going off, which would have been likely caused by someone entering the home through a door from the garage, which was also unlocked. The Jaguar was found this afternoon, unoccupied near Watts Rd. Released 08/31/2018 at 3:07 PM by PIO Joel Despain
