 The MPD arrested a daytime burglar after responding to a home alarm on Tony Drive Monday afternoon. The suspect came out of the house and followed an officer's commands to get on the ground. It was determined electronics had been moved inside the home, and were likely the targets of the break-in. Released 09/28/2016 at 9:59 AM by PIO Joel Despain
