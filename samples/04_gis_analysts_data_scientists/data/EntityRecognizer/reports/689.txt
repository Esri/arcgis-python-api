 She was aware of scams in the Madison area; had spent her working life in the legal field, and was now embarrassed to report to police that she had just been scammed out of $5,500 after someone she believed to be her grandson called asking for help. In this version of a fairly common ruse, the "grandson" claimed to have taken a bus - with friends - from Wisconsin to Nashville to take in a Johnny Cash memorial concert. On the way home, the bus got pulled over by cops, a bit of marijuana was found, and now the "grandson" needed bail money and attorney fees to make it all go away. A man claiming to be her grandson's Tennessee attorney, "David Feldman," got on the phone and coached the victim on how to obtain iTunes gift cards from various local stores. She learned how to scratch off numbers on the back of the cards so the "legal fees" could be made. Fearing for her grandson, the victim - against her better judgment - followed through with directions. "Feldman" was looking for her to purchase even more iTunes cards, but by that time she realized she had been victimized, and had contacted the MPD. It was a Madison Police officer who got on the phone with "Feldman" and told him to cease and desist. Released 08/18/2016 at 12:07 PM by PIO Joel Despain
