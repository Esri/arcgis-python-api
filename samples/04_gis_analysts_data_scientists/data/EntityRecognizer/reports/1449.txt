 A Mt. Horeb motorcyclist told police "it scared the crap out of me," fearing he was going to be shot, after a handgun was pointed at him during a road rage incident on the West Beltline Highway Monday afternoon. The biker said he had given a driver the finger during a dispute over following distance. Shortly thereafter a passenger in the suspect's car displayed the firearm. The victim provided officers with a good description of the car as well as its license plate number. Officers spotted it and later stopped it on Old Middleton Rd. The driver and passenger were arrested on tentative charges listed above. A handgun was seized from beneath the driver's seat. Released 04/19/2016 at 10:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
