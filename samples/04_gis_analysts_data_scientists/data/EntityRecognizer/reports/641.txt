 The MPD took reports from at least five victims Friday morning all of whom had vehicles parked downtown and awoke to find a driver's side or passenger's side window broken out. A couple of victims said it appeared someone had rummaged through the interior of their vehicle, but none believed anything had actually been stolen. Crimes were reported on N. Webster St., Langdon St., Wisconsin Place, and E. Gorham St. Released 12/19/2016 at 11:50 AM by PIO Joel Despain
