A 19-year-old Madison man told police he suffered road rash after being pushed out of a car near Walbridge Avenue Wednesday night. The victim said he arranged, via social media, to purchase some items of clothing from a man he does not know. He got into a car with the man after they arranged to meet at a fast-food restaurant on Milwaukee St. Inside the car the victim found there were actually three men, one of whom had a handgun. He says he was robbed before being pushed out of a door.  Released 03/21/2019 at 11:26 AM by PIO Joel Despain
