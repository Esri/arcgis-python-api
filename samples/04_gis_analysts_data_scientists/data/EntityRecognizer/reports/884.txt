 A husband and wife were watching TV Saturday evening in the living room of their East Bluff Condominium when they heard loud pops coming from somewhere outside. The man told his wife to get down on the floor. They were among many concerned residents who called for police as numerous people were concerned and upset about the rapid gunshots. Officers recovered multiple shell casings from the roadway near the intersection of Troy Dr. and Susan Lane. There were no reports of injuries or property damage. Witnesses saw a rusty, older white car speeding in the area, squealing its tires around the time of the gunshots. Released 07/23/2018 at 3:17 PM by PIO Joel Despain
