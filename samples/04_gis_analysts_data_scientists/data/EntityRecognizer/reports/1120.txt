 A Madison man suffered a broken nose, a concussion, and numerous facial injuries after being attacked inside his E. Washington Ave. apartment last night. The 57-year-old told police two men pushed their way in, and that one was someone from whom he recently purchased drugs. He said the intruders were looking for money, but left empty-handed after being scared off after hearing people who were passing by the outside of his home.
