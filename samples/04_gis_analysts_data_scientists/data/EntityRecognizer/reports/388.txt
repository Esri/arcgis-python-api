 A suspected drug dealer attempted to swallow cocaine and heroin after being chased down by members of the Dane County Narcotics Task Force Thursday afternoon. Officers arrested Rickey L. Webb, age 36, in the Town of Burke after he drove from the Red Roof Inn, 4830 Hayes Rd. He pulled into a parking lot, and then tried to run as police closed in. A search of his hotel room netted more drug evidence. Cash, a digital scale, cocaine powder, cocaine base (crack), and heroin were among items seized. The Task Force had developed information that Webb was peddling drugs from various vehicles while staying at different area motels. Released 01/25/2019 at 3:45 PM by PIO Joel Despain
