 A Madison man suffered significant head injuries and was knocked unconscious during a beating that took place Friday afternoon near the gas pumps at Speedway, 4902 Verona Rd. He was taken to a hospital. The suspect, who was still in the area, was arrested for substantial battery. Police believe this was an extension on an earlier domestic violence case that took place in Fitchburg where a relative of the injured man was the victim, and the arrested man, the suspect.
