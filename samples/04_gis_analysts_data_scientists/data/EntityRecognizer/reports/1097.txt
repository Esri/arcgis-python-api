Late this morning, the MPD was called to the parking lot of the Villager Shopping Mall, 2222 S. Park St., after a witness saw someone firing a gun - from a car - at a man who was inside another vehicle. The witness thought the weapon was a BB or pellet gun. Both victim and suspect drove from the area prior to police arrival. A short time later, a man arrived at a hospital with what appear to be wounds from a pellet gun. He was initially not forthcoming about the injuries. Released 07/12/2017 at 2:21 PM by PIO Joel Despain
