Two loaded handguns were removed from the streets Wednesday as the MPD continues to mount a violence suppression effort in the wake of a record breaking number of shots being fired in the City of Madison. The MPD's North District Community Police Team joined forces with the MPD's Gang Unit and the Dane County Narcotics Task Force to arrest two armed men in separate traffic stops. Keonte J. McClain, age 22, Madison, was taken into custody on a tentative charge of carrying a concealed weapon after a car he was traveling in was stopped in the 2900 block Hoard St. around 3:10 p.m. McClain had a 9mm handgun. Deonte C. Thompson, age 26, Madison, was arrested on the same tentative charge following a stop in the 700 block of Pinecrest Dr. around 10:20 p.m. A loaded 9mm handgun was recovered. Another person in the car with Thompson was Dajuea M. Purnell, age 19, Madison.  The MPD had probable cause to also arrest him for the theft of a Sauk City woman's purse at West Towne Mall on August 24th. There were a total of eight people in the two vehicles that were stopped. Gang Unit detectives indicate all of the young men have ties to local gangs.  Released 09/28/2017 at 10:29 AM by PIO Joel Despain
