On Saturday evening, July 23, 2016 at 7:40 pm officers were sent to the 3100 block of Worthington Ave for reports of shots fired.  Several callers reported hearing multiple shots.  Shell casings were located in and around Worthington Park.  A nearby resident on Webb Avenue reported what appear to be bullet holes in their apartment.  At least two  parked vehicles were struck by bullets. Neither the apartment nor the parked vehicles are believed to have been specifically targeted, but rather were victims of stray bullets. At this time, no injuries have been reported. Anyone with information is asked to call the Madison Police at 255-2345 or Crime stoppers at 266-6014  Released 07/25/2016 at 10:26 AM by P.O.
