 An uncooperative victim suffered an eight-inch slash to his face and a nine-inch slash to a hand last night. Both injuries required stitches. After being cut, the 33-year-old went to a Taft St. home last night asking to use a phone. When police arrived he initially indicated he had been attacked in the area and robbed of his wallet. He did not want to specifically say where the incident occurred, and refused to provide additional details. Officers canvassed the area, but could not locate a crime scene.
