 The MPD arrested a smash-and-grab burglar following a foot chase last night. Reginald D. Funches, age 44, Sun Prairie is accused of throwing a rock through a glass door at Bandung Indonesian Restaurant, 600 Williamson St. and stealing money. What he didn't know was the restaurant's owner was inside at the time of the crime working on a spreadsheet. When the victim heard banging, and then the sound of shattering glass, he called 911 while running out of the backdoor. Officers were not far away and on the scene quickly. They spotted the suspect and chased him down. Just prior to the break-in at Bandung, a rear window had been shattered at the nearby Essen Haus restaurant. Entry was not made, and this is being investigated as an attempted burglary. Because of time and proximity, officers are looking to see if the two cases might be connected.
