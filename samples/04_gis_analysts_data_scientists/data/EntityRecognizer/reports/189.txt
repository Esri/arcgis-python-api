A suspect entered a gas station in the 5400 block of University Ave.  The male suspect attempted to rob the station but was chased off by the clerk.  The suspect did not get away with any money and was last seen running westbound from the station.  This attempted robbery may be related to several others that occurred tonight.  The investigation is continuing.
