The MPD arrested an Illinois man Tuesday afternoon after he tried to use fake prescriptions to buy opioid pain medications from Mallatt's Pharmacy, 1255 Williamson St. A pharmacist thought the prescriptions appeared to have been printed off of a computer and did not look right. An Illinois doctor, whose name was on the prescriptions, was contacted and she said she did not issue the prescriptions. Upon arrest, an investigating officer found the suspect had nearly 40 similar fraudulent prescriptions in his backpack as well as pill bottles from different pharmacies, some of which were empty, some of which contained prescription narcotics.  Released 03/16/2016 at 10:52 AM by PIO Joel Despain
