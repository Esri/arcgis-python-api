 A Madison man contacted the MPD this past week after seeing his stolen $6,000 bike for sale on Craigslist. The ad contained a photo of the high-end two-wheeler.  The 42-year-old victim knew it was his Trek Domane Series Six Carbon Fiber Racing Bicycle because a sticker with his name on it was still affixed to the frame. The Trek had been stolen from the garage of the victim's Twin Pines Dr. home this past August. A MPD detective determined a thief had sold the bike to a pawn shop, and the pawnshop sold it to the man who posted it for sale on Craigslist. The secondary seller did not know the bike was stolen. Thanks to pawn records, a suspect from the August theft was identified and arrested yesterday for felony theft and bail jumping. Released 12/19/2017 at 9:10 AM by PIO Joel Despain
