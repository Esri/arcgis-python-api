As officers boarded a Madison Metro bus Thursday afternoon, a man in the back thrust his hands in the air and announced: "It's a fake gun! It's a fake gun!" The MPD had been called to the East Transfer Point, 102 West Corporate Dr., after the suspect displayed a handgun to two teenagers following an argument while the bus was in transit. The suspect, a 20-year-old Madison man, had a BB gun in a backpack. He claimed the teens had made mention of "having a pole" which he said is slang for having a gun, and that is when he showed them what he had. The teens, who had gotten off the bus at the transfer point, denied possessing any weapons. Released 08/12/2016 at 9:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
