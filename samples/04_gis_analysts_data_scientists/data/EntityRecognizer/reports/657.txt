 A convicted armed robber, who has been passing himself off as a police officer, was arrested by the North District Community Police Team this week. Damian A. James, age 35, was sentenced in 2009 to seven years in prison and five years of extended supervision after being found guilty in Milwaukee County. Recently, multiple witnesses told police James has been in the Isthmus - and other areas of city – wearing a "duty belt" containing a holstered handgun and a gold badge: something similar to what detectives might wear. He has allegedly made statements indicating he is either a police officer, or someone training to be a Madison Police officer. James was arrested following a traffic stop on Packers Ave. Tuesday night. He was wearing a holster containing a BB gun that looked like a real weapon. Officers also found the badge he had been carrying. It had words similar to "concealed carry permit" and the suspect said he bought it at a store. As for the BB gun, he told police he likes guns but can no longer legally carry one since he is a convicted felon. He denied trying to pass himself off as a police officer.
