Witnesses helped police locate a hit-and-run driver following a Saturday evening crash that sent a Madison husband and wife to a hospital with minor injuries. The victims were driving inbound on Williamson St. when a car slammed into them at the intersection with S. Baldwin St. Its driver removed the rear license plate (there was no plate in the front) and fled on foot, leaving his significantly damaged car – airbags deployed – in the middle of the intersection. Concerned residents provided officers with a good description and the man was located a couple of blocks away. He was arrested on a number of tentative charges which are listed above.
