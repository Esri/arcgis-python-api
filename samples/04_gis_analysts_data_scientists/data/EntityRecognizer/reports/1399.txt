 A would-be robber fled empty-handed after a store clerk hit a panic button and called 911. The attempted holdup took place early this morning at Kelley's Market, 2601 Shopko Dr. A masked man kept a hand in his hoodie, intimating he might be armed as he demanded money; however, no weapon was observed. He fled on foot as the clerk called for help. Released 07/20/2018 at 8:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
