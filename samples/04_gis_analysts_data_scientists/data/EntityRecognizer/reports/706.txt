There were no major problems or incidents reported at this year's Freakfest where over 20,000 tickets were sold; however, there were 12 arrests as of 2:00 a.m. Most were cited and released for having open intoxicants on the street, or for disorderly conduct. Several were transported to the detox center, and a few others suffered relatively minor injuries. The MPD would like to thank our partners for assistance during the event: the Madison Fire Department, Dane County Public Safety Communications, Dane County Sheriff's Department, UW Madison Police Department, Fitchburg Police Department, the Middleton Police Department, and City of Madison Parks, Engineering, and Streets. We would also like to thank the vast majority of attendees for making Freakfest a positive community celebration.    Released 10/28/2018 at 2:08 AM by PIO Joel Despain
