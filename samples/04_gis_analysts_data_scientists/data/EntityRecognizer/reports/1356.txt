 A blind man escaped serious injury, but his service dog – a nine-year-old Labrador Retriever – was transported via MPD squad car to a veterinarian following a hit-and-run on W. Johnson St. this morning. The 57-year-old Madison man was on his way to work with his companion around 7:45 a.m. They were in a crosswalk on N. Mills St., and had a walk light to cross W. Johnson St., when a driver ran a red light while eastbound on W. Johnson. The driver was operating a small blue car and did not stop. The victim suffered minor injuries that did not require medical care. His partner suffered at least a front leg injury. A responding officer drove them to a vet. The MPD is reviewing downtown cameras to try to identify the car and driver. Anyone with information is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.  Released 09/05/2017 at 10:59 AM by PIO Joel Despain
