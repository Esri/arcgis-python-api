 A Madison teen was robbed at gunpoint after going to meet a man she only knew from Facebook. The victim and a girlfriend drove to a Schroeder Rd. convenience store parking lot around 1:15 a.m. Saturday for a pre-arranged meeting. Once they parked, two men got into the backseat of the victim's car. One pointed a handgun at the victim's head and robbed her of cash and her cell phone. She said she had originally agreed to meet the man because he needed a ride somewhere.
