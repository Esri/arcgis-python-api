 A 78-year-old pedestrian suffered life-threatening injuries after getting hit by a car while crossing East Washington Ave. last evening. The driver, a 53-year-old Madison man, said he did not see the woman - who was in a crosswalk - until a second or two before impact. He slammed on the brakes, but was unable to prevent striking her. She was taken to a hospital with head and other injuries. A MPD traffic specialist is investigating. There were no signs that the driver was impaired, and he was very cooperative.
