 Madison Police were called to the Kohls Department store for an active motion alarm.  Officers arrived and found the glass doors had been broken.  An off site security company was monitoring video of the store and reported a male had entered the store then left with a large screen TV prior to officers being called. An hour later a Madison officer saw a subject who was carrying a large television box near the Microtel on East Springs drive and when contacting the subject he attempted to run.  The suspect was taken into custody, the 50" television was recovered and returned to the store manager. The suspect was arrested and taken to the Dane County Jail on a charge of Burglary and resisting arrest.  Released 05/31/2016 at 4:55 AM by Sgt. Paul Jacobsen
