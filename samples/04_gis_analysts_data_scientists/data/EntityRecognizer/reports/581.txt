 Four new textbooks, worth a couple of hundred dollars, were delivered to a student's N. Bassett St. home Tuesday morning, and the package in which they were contained was quickly "porch-pirated." A man brought the stolen books to The University Book Store several hours later and attempted to sell them. Employees were aware of the man from past pawn activity and refused to make the purchase. Staff members also located the now empty box - in which the books had been delivered - on top of one of the store's free lockers. It contained the victim's name, mailing address, and tracking information showing the package had just been delivered that morning. Officers located the suspect in the downtown area and he was arrested for theft. Released 02/15/2017 at 10:59 AM by PIO Joel Despain
