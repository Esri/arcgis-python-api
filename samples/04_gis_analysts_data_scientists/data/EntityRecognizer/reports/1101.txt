Two area teens were arrested last night in a stolen car that contained a stolen gun. Both are suspects in numerous area crimes. Alonte T. Kingcade, age 17, Waunakee, fled from the stolen car which was found parked in 500 block of Grand Canyon Blvd. He was chased down by the MPD. An officer suffered a minor injury in the foot pursuit. Damariyah M. Muhammad, age 17, Fitchburg, was arrested inside the vehicle. The MPD's Violent Crimes Unit, the MPD's Gang Unit, and our North and South District Community Police Teams worked in concert to safely take the suspects into custody. The MPD and area law enforcement agencies are united and working in together in an effort to decrease the number of home burglaries, stolen cars, thefts from cars, and gun violence.   Released 06/21/2019 at 10:47 AM by PIO Joel Despain
