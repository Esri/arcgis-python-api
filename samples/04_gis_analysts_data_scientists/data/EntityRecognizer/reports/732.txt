 A Madison woman was visibly upset and shaken as she told downtown officers how a stranger grabbed her buttocks in the 400 block of State St. Tuesday night. The victim was walking with her boyfriend when the suspect began to follow them, asking for money. He told the woman he found her attractive, and then touched her inappropriately. Officers were able to locate the suspect, a 20-year-old man, who told them he is currently homeless and living on the streets. Released 06/28/2017 at 10:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
