On 6/15/2018, shortly after 4:41am, Madison Police were dispatched to the 1300 block of Saint James Court reference a burglary.  The victim stated that approximately 20 minutes before police were called, he woke up to use the restroom and returned to his bedroom to go back to sleep.  As he was dozing off, he recalls ambient light from a hallway creep through his bedroom door, and the a few seconds later, he heard the sound of a door slam on the first floor of the residence. He thought this was too strange of an incident, and got up immediately to investigate. He went downstairs, to the kitchen of the residence, and noticed a window was pushed up and the screen ripped!  He knew this was not normal, and summoned police. In a separate case, officers responded to the 1300 block of Milton Street, at 4:50am, reference a subject who had fled from the Saint James Court address and had entered/attempted to enter a second residence.  The suspect was taken into custody, and when the suspect was interviewed as to why he was in/around either residence, at 4 o'clock in the morning, he advised that he was only looking for a place to stay for the evening.  That explanation was puzzling, as the suspect picked more than one residence to retire for the night, but he was arrested and conveyed to the Dane County Juvenile Reception Center on charges listed above.  Officers did find garbage cans outside of both residences, which aided the suspect in entering the homes.  PO Howard Payne  Released 06/15/2018 at 10:18 AM by P.O.
