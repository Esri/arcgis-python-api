Detectives determined, based on what they could observe of the body, that this is a homicide investigation. Shortly after the discovery, a command post was established along Schneider Road. A multi-jurisdictional forensic team will be brought in to process the scene. This could be a couple of day process, and during that time the public should note that Schneider Road would be closed. Police will remain on the scene throughout this stage of the investigation.
