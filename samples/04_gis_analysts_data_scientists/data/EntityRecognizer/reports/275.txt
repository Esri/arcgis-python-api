A motorcyclist was transported to a hospital via medical helicopter after being found with a serious head injury Friday night. A truck driver was turning his semi around in a dead-end cul-de-sac in the 3800 block of Anderson Rd. when he spotted the taillight of a crashed motorcycle. It was up against a barbed wire fence. He then discovered the injured 47-year-old lying next to a guardrail. Skid marks indicate he tried to stop just prior to the crash. No eyewitnesses could be found. Initial reports indicated the cyclist was expected to survive. Released 09/19/2016 at 9:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
