Officers received a number of complaints about a red Jeep driving erratically on E. Washington Avenue and Oak Street area.  With this being an area of focus, officers continued to search for the vehicle, and finally located it in the 600 block of N. Sherman Avenue.   They contacted the driver, identified as Luis A. Castillejos Jr., and attempted to investigate the allegations levied against him for his driving behavior; involving damage to at least one car that he apparently struck.  Police found Castillejos Jr (the driver) and an 18-year-old male subject in the back seat of the red jeep.  Officers determined that the vehicle was registered to a female, and questions were asked, of the male occupants, as to the registered owner's location.  All occupants pointed to the floor area of the back seat, which is an area where no person was seated or could be seen.  Officers opened the door and noticed a large pillow that covered a large portion of the rear seating area.  Once the pillow was moved, an 18-year-old unresponsive female appeared.  The officers were extremely concerned about the welfare of this female, who was not able to communicate any information to police or care for herself.  Emergency medical attention was summoned for the female, and many unanswered questions continued to posed to both male occupants. Officers smelled alcohol on the driver, and that coupled with Castillejos Jr. driving behavior led police to believe he may be impaired.  Castillejos Jr. was giving an opportunity to substantiate his sobriety, by his participation in sobriety testing, but that proved to not work in his favor; as he was taken into custody for charges listed.  Officers developed a number of stories from the two male subjects, but were never able to obtain credible statements about various factors of this case. PO Howard Payne  Released 08/11/2017 at 4:07 PM by P.O.
