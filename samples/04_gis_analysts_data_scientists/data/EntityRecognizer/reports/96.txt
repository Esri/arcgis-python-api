Victim was walking home after walking a friend to his residence.  He was approached by the two suspects, one who presented what was described as a black semi-auto handgun, and demanded the victim's cell phone.  Suspects then asked multiple times if he owned a car, to which the victim stated he did not.  Suspects fled the immediate area with approximately $30 and the victim's cell phone.
