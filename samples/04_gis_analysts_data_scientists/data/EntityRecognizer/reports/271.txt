 Two Madison Police officers boarded a Madison Fire Department Lake Rescue Team boat and worked with firefighters to pull a 39-year-old Madison man from icy Lake Mendota waters near Tenney Park around midnight. The man had run into the lake after crashing a car into a tree in the 1600 block of N. Sherman Ave. He had sped away from a Maple Bluff police officer following a routine traffic stop. The MPD was being called to back Maple Bluff up, and a MPD officer was quickly on scene after the car hit the tree. The area of the lake entered by the driver has some open water, but also a lot of ice. The MPD officer knew he could not safely venture in and called for the MFD to respond with a rescue boat. After MFD arrived, two MPD officers boarded the craft with the firefighters, and the team set off into heavy winds. The man was in chest-deep water, about 75 feet from shore. He ignored requests to come to the boat. Instead, he moved toward its large fan. The two firefighters leapt into the water to keep the man from it, and pulled him toward the police officers. One officer, in his report, wrote: "Plunging my hands into the frigid, icy waters, I grabbed hold of (the man) along with (the other police officer) as the firefighters pushed from below. (The suspect) did not resist but offered no assistance getting himself into the boat." While in the water for about a half hour, his body temperature had dropped to 87 degrees (normal is 98.6). He remains hospitalized at this hour. Released 03/08/2017 at 9:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
