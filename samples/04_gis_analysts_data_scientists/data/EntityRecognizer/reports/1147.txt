Zachary Marcotte was on a Madison Metro bus and when it stopped at the West Transfer Point switched to another bus.  Both buses were waiting a few minutes before moving on to their next location and the bus drivers were outside talking.  They then had to go onto the bus to break up a disturbance between Marcotte and other individuals.  Those individuals left the bus and area.  The bus drivers were again outside talking when Marcotte exited the bus and confronts them.  They do what they can to back away and maintain distance from Marcotte.  A MPD officer arrives and makes contact with Marcotte, who aggresses on the officer.  The officer pushes him away.  Marcotte continues to move towards the officer in a confrontational manner.  A taser is then deployed on Marcotte and he is taken into custody.  There were no injuries and Marcotte will be booked into the Dane County Jail.  Released 09/24/2016 at 3:10 AM by Lt.
