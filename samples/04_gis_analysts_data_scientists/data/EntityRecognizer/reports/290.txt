 Some grocery shoppers jumped into action to break up a fight in a Woodman's Market food aisle last night. When it was over, an 18-year-old victim explained to police how she was in the process of getting some taco seasoning when she suddenly took a spray of mace to the face. Sticking her arm out, and unleashing the stream, was another teen, someone with whom the victim has a history of conflict. A third teen was also part of the unprovoked sneak attack. She was recording it all on her cell phone. After the pepper spraying, the victim started swinging and the two young women ended up slugging it out until uninvolved shoppers intervened. The victim suffered bumps and scratches as well as swollen and watery eyes. The suspect and her accomplice fled prior to officers' arrival.   Released 04/18/2018 at 12:05 PM by PIO Joel Despain
