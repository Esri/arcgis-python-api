 Three teens were seen running away from the parking lot of Rocky Rococo, 4556 Monona Dr., moments after someone shot out a car window with a BB gun. A witness said the young men were all white guys with shaggy hairdos wearing black clothing. They reminded the caller of what Justin Bieber looked like when he was of high school age. Officers were not able to find them while checking nearby neighborhoods.   Released 05/09/2018 at 3:27 PM by PIO Joel Despain
