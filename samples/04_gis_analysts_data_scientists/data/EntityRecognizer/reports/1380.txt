 The victim said he and his roommates typically leave the front door to their Saint James Court apartment unlocked. That was the case Friday night when a burglar came in and stole the 19-year-old's backpack containing his laptop computer. The MPD continues to emphasize the importance of keeping homes and vehicles locked. (NOTE: There is currently a problem with the Incident Report system template where some addresses are not being accepted by the network. That is why MPD Central District is listed above.)
