A Madison man, on his way to a shooting range to sight in his AR15 rifle, stopped at East Towne Mall yesterday for a coffee and a doughnut. While inside, three teens stole his black Acura sedan, containing the loaded weapon. The 78-year-old had his car keys, but he is also the victim of a previous home burglary where someone stole the fob to his Acura. The MPD is reviewing surveillance video with hopes of identifying the suspects. Released 10/26/2018 at 9:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
