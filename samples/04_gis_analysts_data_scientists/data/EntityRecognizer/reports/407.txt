North District officers are investigating a rash of graffiti from over the weekend as someone used red spray paint on homes, vehicles, trailers and the Blackhawk Middle School. Some of the criminal damage included swear words and crude drawings of body parts, but nothing that could be construed as being racist of anti-Semitic was located.  Released 02/05/2019 at 9:08 AM by PIO Joel Despain
