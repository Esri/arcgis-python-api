 Patrol officers and members of the MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit are leafleting areas of Madison where burglars and thieves are committing crimes. Fliers advise of an uptick in garage burglaries. Early yesterday morning, golf clubs, a compound bow and other items were stolen from a garage in the 5700 block of Barton Rd. after residents forgot to close the door. After investigating the crime, an officer distributed some of the fliers to the surrounding neighborhood. They include crime prevention tips like: Make sure your overhead and side garage doors are closed and locked, even when you are at home. Bicycles have been taken from garages while residents are home. Keep your vehicle doors locked when parked in your driveway or garage overnight. Suspects are taking garage door openers which would allow them to gain access to your garage/house. DO NOT leave valuables; including spare house or car keys in your vehicle. Spare car keys have led to your vehicle being stolen. Leaving purses and wallets has led to credit card fraud. Report any suspicious people or vehicles to the police. Please obtain any license plates on suspicious vehicles.     Released 06/28/2016 at 10:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
