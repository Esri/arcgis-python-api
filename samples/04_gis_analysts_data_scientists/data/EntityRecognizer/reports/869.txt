The victim was walking home from MATC when he was approached by three suspects on bikes.   One suspect began telling the victim that he looked like the "guy that shot my friend."  The victim tried to ignore them and continued walking.  The suspects continued to following, asking the victim where was the gun or money.  At Hoffman St., one suspect approached the victim and used some type of stun gun against the victim.   The victim heard the stun gun sparking, but it didn't incapacitate the victim.  The suspects fled on bikes shortly after that.  The victim was not injured during this incident.  Released 11/20/2016 at 12:06 AM by Sgt.
