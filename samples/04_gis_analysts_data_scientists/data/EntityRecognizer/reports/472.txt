A large work truck was driving southbound on Whitney Way when it drifted to the left over the median and ended up crashing into a utility pole on the east side of Whitney Way in front of the Westgate Shopping Center.  The crash caused the utility pole to land on top of the truck.  MG&E is currently working on removing the pole.  At this time northbound Whitney Way traffic is being diverted at Odana Rd, which will likely continue until early evening.  It appears the driver of the truck had a medical event which caused the crash.  He is being treated at a local hospital.  Investigation continuing.  Released 12/24/2018 at 1:45 PM by Lt.
