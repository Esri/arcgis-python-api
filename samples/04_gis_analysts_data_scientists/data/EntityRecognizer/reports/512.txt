 The MPD was called to a house party in the 400 block of W. Mifflin St. early Saturday morning after witnesses saw an attendee using his cell phone to surreptitiously take "upskirt" photos or videos of some women at the gathering. The suspect was contacted and arrested by officers.  Released 02/13/2017 at 1:42 PM by PIO Joel Despain
