The MPD arrested a 60-year-old man yesterday for an attack that took place inside a woman's downtown apartment on October 7th. The victim says the suspect is homeless and she occasionally lets him stay in her home. On the night of the 7th, she says he suddenly became violent, smashing her head against walls, knocking her down, putting his boot on her throat, and stomping on her chest multiple times. The suspect broke her phone, and she feared he was trying to kill her. She was able to flee her apartment and run into the street where she sought help. Officers have been looking for the suspect, and located him yesterday.. Released 10/18/2017 at 9:15 AM by PIO Joel Despain
