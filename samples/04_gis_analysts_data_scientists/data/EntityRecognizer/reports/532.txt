 Scam artists were successful this week in bilking a Madison man out of $3,000 after convincing him there was a warrant out for his arrest. In order to avoid going to jail he was told he needed to send funds via a Walmart MoneyGram. The 72-year-old said the caller identified himself as "Jeffrey Hook" from the "sheriff's department." "Hook" told the victim he had been sent a subpoena to appear in U.S. Federal Court, and failed to appear, thus the arrest warrant. After making several transactions, the victim contacted the MPD.
