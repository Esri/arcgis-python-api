A night time worker at Jimmy John's was taking out the garbage when the suspect came running up to him.  The suspect pointed a gun at the victim and ordered him back into Jimmy John's.  The suspect then robbed the store of an undisclosed amount of cash.  The suspect then fled on foot.  A K-9 track was attempted, which indicated the suspect had a vehicle waiting nearby.  The investigation is on-going at this time.  Released 02/01/2018 at 2:04 AM by Sgt.
