A Reston Heights Dr. homeowner, and a buddy who was over for a visit, had a handgun pointed at them after they chased two teenage burglars last evening. "Back the f- off!" yelled the gunman, who then stated: "On my mother!" The victims did back up, fearing they might be shot. The homeowner's wife witnessed the threat and called 911. The victims had chased the teens to a nearby getaway car, and that is where the driver pulled out the weapon. Officers were in the area quickly. They spotted the getaway car, which was reported as being stolen out of Monona, but terminated a very short pursuit. The victims were not happy that officers had stopped the chase, and MPD's Standard Operating Procedure was explained. The incident started as the homeowners were in the process of saying goodbye to their friend. As they came outside, the two teens ran from the garage. A short time earlier, a nearby Juneberry Dr. resident yelled out "who is that?" She had just heard the door from her unlocked garage to the house open. A would-be burglar ran from her home. It's believed the Juneberry Dr. and Reston Heights Dr. crimes are connected. Released 10/23/2018 at 9:29 AM by PIO Joel Despain
