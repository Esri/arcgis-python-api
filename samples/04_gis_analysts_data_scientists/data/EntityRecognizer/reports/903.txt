 A mother driving with her young son called police yesterday afternoon after a man in another car pulled up next to them at a John Nolen Dr. stoplight. He appeared to be pleasuring himself while staring at them. She pulled ahead a few feet in an attempt to discontinue the contact, and the suspect followed suit, continuing the lewd and lascivious activity, which was also observed by the child. His mother provided a description of the man and his car, which are listed above. Released 02/02/2018 at 10:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
