 A Madison teen told police he was walking in the 4400 block of Pflaum Rd. Friday afternoon when a black SUV pulled up near him. Four young men got out, started yelling at him, and one pointed a handgun at the victim. He ran inside a nearby restaurant to call 911. The foursome got back in the SUV and drove off. It appears the victim has some type of connection to at least of them, but the motivation for the crime was not clear. Released 12/12/2016 at 10:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
