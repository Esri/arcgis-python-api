For the second time in a week the MPD has arrested the same woman for robbery following another disturbance inside a downtown restaurant. In the latest case, which took place Saturday morning, Raeven Johnson, age 21, no permanent address, busted a bottle of Sriracha Hot Sauce inside Teddywedgers, 101 State St. Employees told police Johnson had first asked a customer for money, and then inquired if employees would give her money or food. When she was told she needed to leave, she took a 23-ounce bottle of hot sauce – which Teddywedgers makes available to customers - and shattered its base on the counter's edge. This sent red sauce flying all over the small restaurant. The suspect, while holding the neck of the broken bottle, pointed jagged glass at employees while threatening to harm them. She ended up throwing the bottle at an employee. She failed to connect and fled. Officers located the suspect and arrested her on tentative charges listed above. She was also taken into custody on December 3rd following a robbery at a W. Gorham St. pizza parlor. Released 12/10/2018 at 11:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
