A 56-year-old Madison man feared for his life as he waved his arms in the air, trying to get a speeding van to slow down as it raced towards him on Waxwing Lane Saturday afternoon. The victim had to quickly step out of the way to avoid getting hit. Moments earlier, the MPD had been attempting to deal with the driver, and his passenger, after being called to check on the welfare of both. The man and woman were unconscious, and inside the van which was parked but running. Just as officers attempted to help them, the driver awakened and hit the gas, even though he was being ordered to turn off the ignition. The officers, who were out on foot at the time of the getaway, did not pursue the van, but were able to identify the driver. There is probable cause to arrest him for first degree reckless endangerment and fleeing an officer.   Released 04/15/2019 at 10:58 AM by PIO Joel Despain
