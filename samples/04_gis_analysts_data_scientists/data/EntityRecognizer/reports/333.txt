 A homeless man said he was knocked unconscious last night during a drug deal in upper State St. There was a dispute over how much was to be paid for a small amount of marijuana the victim was purchasing. He says the suspect grabbed all of his money, which was not a lot, and that he was injured trying to get it back. He says he went to the ground after being punched in the face, and also struck in the head with the butt of a handgun. When he regained consciousness, he was able to borrow a passerby's phone and call 911. He was taken to a hospital with an orbital bone fracture and a significantly bruised eye. Central District officers have not yet located the suspect. Released 05/09/2018 at 10:18 AM by PIO Joel Despain
