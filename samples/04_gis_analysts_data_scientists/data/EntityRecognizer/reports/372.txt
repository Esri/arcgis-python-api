There were no significant issues or crimes reported during the Mifflin Street party this afternoon. As of 5:30 p.m., 35 citations had been issued, most for alcohol issues. Of the 35, one person went to jail and another to the Dane County Detoxification Center. The vast majority of those in attendance were well-behaved. A steady rain likely held numbers down with around 3,500 at the party at any one time. The MPD thanks the Dane County Sheriff's Department for assistance in keeping everyone safe today.
