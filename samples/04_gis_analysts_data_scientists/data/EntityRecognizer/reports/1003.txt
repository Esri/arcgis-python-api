The MPD arrested an 18-year-old man on a tentative charge of disorderly conduct after he followed a woman into a Memorial High School women's bathroom shortly after 5:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The woman – a student's parent - was attending an athletic event and said the man entered the stall next to the one she was using. The arrested man is not connected to the school and had been warned by the MPD's Educational Resource Officer earlier this week to not be on the property after he was found loitering in the school's parking lot Tuesday afternoon. Police were notified of yesterday's incident this morning, and the man was arrested at his home. Released 05/05/2017 at 1:55 PM by PIO Joel Despain
