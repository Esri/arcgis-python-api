 Bar patrons and employees helped hold a suspect down until police arrived early this morning after the man created a disturbance - and punched a couple of people - inside the Irish Pub, 317 State St. One of those battered is a 36-year-old woman. She and others were trying to calm the suspect down when she was struck in in the head and knocked to the ground. Witnesses said the suspect punched another man so hard the victim's head bounced off of a door. The suspect told everyone in the bar he was ready to fight them all after he was asked to leave. He was arrested for three counts of battery and disorderly conduct. Released 08/09/2018 at 11:15 AM by PIO Joel Despain
