 A downtown resident, who says he has been burglarized in the past, said he decided to confront people outside of his home with a look-alike gun early Sunday morning after hearing voices. He pointed the weapon at a 22-year-old woman and her male friend as they were in back of her nearby W. Mifflin St. residence enjoying a campfire. The victims were so shocked and scared they ran inside. Officers were able to locate the gunman at his apartment. He was very remorseful, and so sick about what he had done, that he had thrown his Airsoft gun in the trash. An officer retrieved it. The orange tip had been painted black and it looked very much like a real firearm. The officer told the suspect his actions could have gotten himself, or someone else shot. He understood and said he would cooperative anyway he could with the investigation. The officer told him reports would be forwarded to a Central District lieutenant, and that he could be cited or arrested. Later, around 3:00 a.m., the MPD and Madison Fire Department were dispatched to the same backyard fire ring where a moped was now on fire. The suspect from the gun incident said he had nothing to do with the arson. The MFD put out the blaze.. Released 02/22/2016 at 11:59 AM by PIO Joel Despain
