The victim and a female friend left the VFW and were walking to a car parked in the lot.  The suspect approached them and struck the victim in the head with his fist, knocking her to the ground.  The suspect took her purse and fled on foot.  A K-9 track was conducted but did not locate the suspect or purse.  Released 04/16/2016 at 12:11 AM by Sgt.
