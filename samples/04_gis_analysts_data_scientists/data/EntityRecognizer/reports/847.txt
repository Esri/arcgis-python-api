 A Gerald St. resident looked out a window of her home Wednesday night and noticed the dome light of her car on. She could see a thief was inside. Her male roommate went outside, and gave chase for a short distance before deciding it best for to let police do the pursuing. The MPD was called, and officers were provided with a good description. The suspected thief, a 15-year-old, was spotted walking on Portage Ave. He had a bag of coins in his sweatshirt which the victim identified as having been in her car. The money was returned and the teen was cited for theft. Released 07/01/2016 at 11:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
