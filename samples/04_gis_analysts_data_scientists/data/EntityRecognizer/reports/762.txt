 A would-be armed robbery was foiled last week when a store owner grabbed a baseball bat and chased a masked gunman from the Madison Food Mart, 902 E. Johnson St. The victim did not immediately report the crime to police. It took place a bit after half past ten last Wednesday night. Released 06/07/2016 at 12:17 PM by PIO Joel Despain
