 The MPD warned two 13-year-old boys to cease and desist after they were caught going door-to-door in the West District claiming to be raising money for a Madison School Community Recreation football program. A suspicious homeowner contacted MSCR and learned they were not fundraising and do not engage in door-to-door solicitations. The MPD was contacted and an officer located the teens. They tried to claim they were conducting legitimate business, but later admitted they were not associated with MSCR and were actually just trying to get some free money. The boys were given and verbal warning. There have been several similar complaints in the West District in the past month.    Released 08/26/2016 at 12:43 PM by PIO Joel Despain
