Detectives in the MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit fondly refer to her as the "pawn star." She is, in fact, a civilian employee who serves the community by tracking activities at local second hand stores and pawn shops. Currently, the "pawn star" is getting kudos from employees at Heid Music, 7948 Tree Lane. The store was recently hit, on four separate occasions, by thieves who stole three flutes and a clarinet with a combined retail value of more than $10,000. The "pawn star" found three of the instruments had been sold at area pawn shops. Businesses are required to take a photo and record the names of those selling items. Using said records, the "pawn star" was able to positively identify a primary co-conspirators in the instrument heists. The lead detective tracked him down at the Dane County Jail after he was arrested by another agency on a probation hold. Marcus M. Pennie, age 41, Madison, is now also facing tentative charges of felony retail theft and theft by false representation. At least one more arrest is anticipated in the musical instrument theft spree, thanks in large part to the work of the MPD's one and only "pawn star."  Released 04/05/2018 at 12:17 PM by PIO Joel Despain
