 A large spruce tree prevented a SUV from smashing into a home in the 2200 block of North Sherman Ave. last night. The collision left a debris field across a couple of lawns with at least one window of a nearby house broken. Bottles of alcohol were found inside the heavily damaged SUV. Its driver was taken to a hospital with broken ribs and other non-life-threatening injuries. She was arrested for third offense of drunken driving. Released 07/31/2018 at 10:03 AM by PIO Joel Despain
