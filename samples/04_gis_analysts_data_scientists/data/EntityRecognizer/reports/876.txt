 The MPD arrested a suspected bank robber in the past hour after Old National Bank, 5750 Raymond Rd., was hit around 2:30 p.m. The criminal indicated he had a weapon, but none was seen. After getting cash, he fled, with witnesses - who had been in the bank - following a safe distance behind. The MPD's West District station is very close to the crime scene, and officers were in the area extremely quickly. Their arrival, coupled with witnesses being able to point to the area where the suspect had run, led to the immediate apprehension. It took place in a parking lot across from the bank. There were no injuries. The suspect has been detained and taken to the MPD's West District station. Released 02/06/2017 at 3:32 PM by PIO Joel Despain
