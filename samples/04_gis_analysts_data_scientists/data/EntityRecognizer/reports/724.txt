 A 10-year-old girl ran home yesterday afternoon after a stranger began speaking to her in the area of Radford Dr. and Summertown Dr. She said the man approached from the street and walked near her while asking for her name. He also wanted to know how old she was, and where her parents were. The contact made her nervous and scared, so she took off to tell her parents about the encounter. They then called the MPD.
