Clerks were closing up the store at the end of thei day, and escorted two customers out of the store.  One customer then told the clerk to give him the money, and then repeated himself making a comment about shooting if they did not give him the money.  No weapon was seen.  Suspect was given money from the register and he fled the establishment.  There were no reported injuries as a result of this incident, and the investigation is continuing.
