An adult called MPD after their children reported being approached by a male in a blue mini van.  This incident occurred at approximately 5:15pm.  The children reported that the blue mini van pulled up and the male occupant asked if they wanted to get in the van.  The children ran home and reported to an adult. Information was also provided that this same subject may have been in the area a couple of weeks ago.  On that occasion, the occupant of the vehicle asked the children if they wanted something that he offered them.  The children left the area on that occasion as well. The suspect vehicle may have some rust on the bottom of the front doors.  Anyone having any information is asked to contact the non-emergency dispatch number (255-2345) and ask to speak to an officer.
