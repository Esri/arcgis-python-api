 Officers were dispatched to a fight in progress last night near the Wisconsin Historical Museum, at the top of State St. As the first officer arrived, he saw two men grappling with one knocking the other to the pavement. The man who was going down struck his head on concrete and was knocked out. He was taken to a hospital. The other combatant was arrested for substantial battery.
