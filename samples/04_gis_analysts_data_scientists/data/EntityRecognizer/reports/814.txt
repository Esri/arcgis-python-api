 A Middleton man was arrested for his sixth offense of drunken driving early Saturday morning after the pickup he was driving sideswiped a car that was parked at a PDQ store's gas pumps, 4402 East Buckeye Rd. A Stoughton woman was in the driver's seat at the time of the minor collision. It took off her rearview mirror and left scratches on her 2013 Dodge Charger. She was very upset. A short distance behind the truck, at the time of the sideswiping, was a concerned driver who had been following the suspect after the arrested man nearly crashed into the witness's car on Highway 51. The witness and the Stoughton woman were able to provide officers with eyewitness accounts. Released 10/24/2016 at 11:05 AM by PIO Joel Despain
