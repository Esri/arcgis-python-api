 A 22-year-old Tree Lane resident awoke early yesterday morning to the sounds of scratching noises coming from outside her bedroom window. She could see her blinds were moving, and realized she had left her window unlocked. She looked and saw a shirtless man standing outside of her window. He fled as police were called. Responding officers found the window's screen propped up against an exterior wall of the victim's apartment building. Released 09/05/2018 at 2:30 PM by PIO Joel Despain
