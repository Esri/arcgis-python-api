As hoped and anticipated, there were no serious incidents reported during Freakfest 2017. Colder weather may have helped keep the crowd size down with nearly 19,000 purchasing tickets for the 12th annual State St. celebration. As of 1:30 a.m., there had been 11 arrests with two of those people going to jail. Others were cited and released for relatively minor violations like having an open intoxicant in the street. The Madison Fire Department responded to nine minor medical incidents. The MPD would like to thank our partners: the Dane County Sheriff's Department, the UW-Madison Police Department, and the Madison Fire Department for helping us keep Freakfest safe again this year.
