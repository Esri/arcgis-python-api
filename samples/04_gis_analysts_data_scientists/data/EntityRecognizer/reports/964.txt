 A hotel guest was outside having a cigarette last night when he says a stranger sprayed a chemical in his eyes, and then hit him in the head with the canister containing the substance. The men ended up rolling on the ground outside of Best Western East Towne Suites, 4801 Annamark Dr. The victim said cash was taken from his pocket and the robber drove off in a red Dodge pickup truck. Madison Fire Department paramedics treated the 55-year-old for exposure to what could have been pepper spray. Released 01/23/2019 at 9:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
