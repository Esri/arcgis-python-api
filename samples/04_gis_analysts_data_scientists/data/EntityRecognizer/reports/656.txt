A strong-armed-robber ripped a purse off the shoulder of a 60-year-old Marshall woman over the noon hour inside Shopko, 2201 Zeier Rd. The victim tried to keep hold of her purse, and - in the struggle - was tossed to the ground. A security guard chased the robber outside. During the pursuit, the criminal fell and dropped the purse. The victim got it back, but her phone was now broken. She complained of head, neck, and back pain but did not wish to be seen by Madison Fire paramedics.
