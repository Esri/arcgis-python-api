 An 81-year-old Watertown man said he tried to hit the brakes, but his foot slipped and got stuck on the accelerator Monday afternoon. The accidental maneuver led to a series of events and a crash where fortunately no one was hurt.  It all started when the Watertown driver was involved in a fender bender. He struck a car in front of him after it stopped in traffic along busy W. Johnson St. As he went to brake and inadvertently punched the accelerator, his car jumped the curb. A side mirror clipped a couple of pedestrians who were on a sidewalk. His car next hit a light pole, knocking it into traffic, and came to a stop as it became wedged between the downed pole and a building. The Watertown man was cited for deviation from a designated lane.  Released 12/21/2016 at 11:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
