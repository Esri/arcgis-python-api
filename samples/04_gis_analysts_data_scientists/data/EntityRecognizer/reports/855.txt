 Madison Police were in the area of Visions Night Club in the 3500 block of East Washington Avenue at 01:20 hours when multiple shots fired were heard near Pedro's Restaurant.  A black male was seen running from the area who appeared to have a gun in his hand. A perimeter was set up and canine responded to the scene.  Minutes later a resident in the 3500 block of Ridgeway Ave reports he believes someone broke in and he is hearing someone upstairs.  That residence was surrounded as it was also very near where officers had last seen the suspect running.  This incident is still on going at this time. UPDATE:  Residence was checked with negative results and no suspects located at this time.  Investigation is ongoing.  Released 09/19/2017 at 4:44 AM by Sgt. Paul Jacobsen
