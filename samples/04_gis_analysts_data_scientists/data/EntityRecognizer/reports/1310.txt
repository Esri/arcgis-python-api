 A 14-year-old boy suffered serious, but non-life-threatening injuries Saturday afternoon after being hit by a car at the intersection of S. Thompson Dr. and Milwaukee St. Witnesses said the child darted out into the path of a car being driven by 67-year-old Madison man. The driver was sober and told police he had no time to stop. The teen was in a crosswalk, and was given a warning for sudden pedestrian movement into traffic. He suffered a skull fracture, hip fracture, broken arm, several broken ribs, lacerated spleen, and a partially collapsed lung. Released 09/04/2018 at 11:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
