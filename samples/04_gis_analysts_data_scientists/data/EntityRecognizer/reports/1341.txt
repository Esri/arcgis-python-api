 A Madison grandfather has been conned out of $9,000 after being fooled into believing his grandson was in "Madison Police" custody. The 72-year-old received a call last week from someone he believed to be his grandson. The "grandson" – who said he was calling because his "parents" would "flip out," put "Sgt. Richard Daley" of the "MPD" on the line. The victim came to believe his grandson had been arrested following a car accident; that heroin was found in the grandson's car; that he passed a lie detector test and police believed him to be innocent. However, in order for the "grandson" to get out of the hoosegow 10 percent of the $90,000 bail amount would be needed. The victim was further told there was a "gag order" on the bail money, so he could not talk with anyone about this. He proceeded to follow instructions:  He withdrew $9,000 from his credit union. He placed the case in a manila envelope. He went to the a UPS store and sent the "bail money" to an address in Brooklyn, NY. After doing all this, the man's actual grandson called, and that's when he realized he had been taken by smooth-talking, not to mention convincing, scam artists.   Released 09/21/2016 at 11:55 AM by PIO Joel Despain
