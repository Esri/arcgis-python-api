The Madison Police responded to the Shell gas station for a report of an armed robbery.  The clerk working at the store reported that a Hispanic male (see description above) entered the store alone, and came behind the counter while holding a knife.  He took an undisclosed amount of cash from the register and then fled the store.  The clerk was not injured. The Madison Police believe this robbery appears related to the robbery that occurred at the same location on September 2.  The investigation of this incident is ongoing.  Anyone with information regarding this incident is encouraged to contact the Madison Police Department or the Madison area Crimestoppers program.  Released 09/11/2018 at 2:41 AM by Lt.
