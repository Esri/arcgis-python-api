 Officers utilized a newly acquired 40mm less lethal launcher to help save the life of a suicidal man last Thursday night. A family member contacted the MPD after learning the distraught man was threatening to take an overdose of pills and was fashioning a weapon by taping a hammer and a knife together. Officers - who had formulated a detailed de-escalation plan - tried to convince the man that they were only there to help him. He did unlock and open his door, but when officers entered he was holding a baseball bat in batter's stance. He ignored orders to drop it, and the 40mm less lethal was successfully deployed. The man dropped the bat. The homemade weapon was found nearby, and he was taken to a hospital for help. The attached video shows how the 40 mm less lethal is used, and how it compares to a Taser or a less lethal shotgun round. The demonstration was part of a MPD news conference last month.   Released 11/27/2017 at 3:20 PM by PIO Joel Despain
