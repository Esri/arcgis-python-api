 The owner of a van that struck and damaged the Overture Center Friday night was arrested Sunday after he turned himself into police. He would not answer questions, and it is not known if he, or someone else, was behind the wheel at the time of the crash. Witnesses said the van also struck a couple of parked cars, although officers could not immediately find any that were damaged. The van's front bumper came off when the Overture Center was hit. Following calls from witnesses to 911, a MPD officer did spot and try to pull the van over as it left the downtown. The officer witnessed the van strike a traffic sign on East Washington Ave. and keep going. The officer did not chase the van, but was able to identify its owner after running the plate. The owner has been cited for a number of infractions including vehicle owner liability for hit-and-run, and vehicle owner liability for fleeing and eluding. Those tentative charges will change if MPD can develop probable cause that the owner was the person operating Friday night. Released 05/06/2019 at 11:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
