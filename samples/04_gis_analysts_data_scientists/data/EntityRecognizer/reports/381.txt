A building manager says she gets numerous complaints from residents about the same disturbing actions of a certain tenant, and the MPD has now cited the suspect twice in the past week for lewd and lascivious behavior, including yesterday when a MPD officer personally witnessed the suspect exposing himself. The manager of a Monterey Drive apartment building told the officer the suspect had his door open to a common hallway and people were seeing him again Sunday evening. The officer looked around the corner and could see the suspect, sans clothing, and "posing" with a big smile on his face. Last week, a father said the man was in a front picture window of the apartment doing the same thing as the victim and his young daughter walked past. In addition, the father said there is a park across the street where lots of children play.    Released 05/20/2019 at 11:03 AM by PIO Joel Despain
