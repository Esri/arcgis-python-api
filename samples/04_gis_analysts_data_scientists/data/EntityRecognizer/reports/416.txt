 A Madison man, who feared he was about to be arrested and deported, was conned out of $15,000 this week. The victim is originally from another country. Wednesday morning, he got a call that appeared to come from 911. He was told he had tax problems and the IRS would be calling next. He was soon conversing with someone claiming to be from that agency, as well as another man who passed himself off as a police commissioner. The victim was told if he hung up and contacted anyone else he would be taken into custody immediately. Fearful, he followed directions going to several different area stores to purchase multiple iTunes gift cards. He was ordered to scratch the backs and provide the men on the phone with the cards' numbers. He was told he would be emailed a form to which he could attach transactional receipts. The email never came and he realized - hours later –that he had been ripped-off. That's when he called the MPD. Released 08/12/2016 at 10:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
