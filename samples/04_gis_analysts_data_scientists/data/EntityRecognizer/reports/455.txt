  A construction site superintendent was nowhere near the scene of the crime early Sunday morning, but was watching surveillance video, in real-time, from his location when he spotted suspect wandering in a secure area of a building site in the 400 block of Division St. He called police, and kept monitoring the feed, as a MPD officer arrived to make an arrest. Bolt cutters were located near a perimeter fence. The MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit has been working recent cases where copper wire and tools are being stolen from construction sites. In this case, officers had probable cause to arrest the suspect for trespass.  Released 08/28/2017 at 11:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
