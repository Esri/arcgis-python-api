 Friday evening, a burglar stole seven guns from a house on Huxley St. The intruder would have likely taken more weapons had the homeowners – a husband and wife - not returned when they did. The husband said he could hear a racket coming from an area near his garage when he and his wife got back from a dining out. They discovered a rear window to their house broken with weapons from two gun cases stolen. Officers found several behind the garage, and it's believed the burglar left them behind, and took off with others after realizing residents had come back home.
