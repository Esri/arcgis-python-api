 Downtown officers are looking to identify a thief who has stolen wallets from at least three women in the past couple of months, and then used stolen credit cards to ring up purchases at area businesses. In the latest case, a 62-year-old Kiel, WI, woman - in Madison for a Badger football game - had her wallet stolen last Friday from the Old Fashioned restaurant, 23 N. Pinckney St.  A 23-year-old Madison woman was similarly victimized on August 25th when her backpack was stolen from Michelangelo's Coffee House, 114 State St. A third similar case was reported on July 9th when a 22-year-old Madison woman had her wallet stolen out of her bag which she had placed next to her chair at Fair Trade Coffee House. The MPD has found surveillance images of the thief and officers are looking to identify him. Anyone with information is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.    Released 09/05/2018 at 3:15 PM by PIO Joel Despain
