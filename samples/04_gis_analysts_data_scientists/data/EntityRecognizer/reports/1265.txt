A nine-year-old girl, on her way to school this morning, says a man in a small red pickup truck tried to get her to come with him as she rode her bicycle on Kipling Drive near the intersection with Scott Lane. The student said the truck had a dent and a scratch on the driver's side. The man was white with long and curly gray or white hair. He was wearing a red hat, a blue jean jacket over a gray shirt, and blue jeans.  She says he slowed down near her and asked if she wanted to come to his home where he had candy, toys, popcorn: "All things kids like," she quoted him as saying. The girl quickly peddled to her school, Lakeview Elementary, 1802 Tennyson Lane, and immediately reported the incident to the first teacher she saw.   Released 10/04/2017 at 12:36 PM by PIO Joel Despain
