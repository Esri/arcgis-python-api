Shortly after 3:37am, Madison Police Officers were sent to the area of 2703 W. Beltline Hwy (7 Eleven) reference a panic alarm from this location.  Multiple gun shots were heard by the gas station attendant, and at least four vehicles were seen quickly leaving the lot.  Responding officers located at least four 9mm bullet casings in the parking lot, which seemed consistent with what had been described.  It is still unclear as to what this ordeal was all about, but no victims were located as a result of this incident.  Officers did canvass the immediate area, and there seemed to be no apparent damage to property in proximity to that of the 7 Eleven.  This case remains under investigation, and anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Madison Police Department with details that might further investigatory efforts.
