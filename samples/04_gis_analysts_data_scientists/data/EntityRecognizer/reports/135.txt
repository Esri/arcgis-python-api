 An intoxicated 21-year-old Mt. Horeb man suffered non life-threatening injuries after jumping from a moving car and then running into the path of a SUV early Sunday morning. The man had been a passenger in the car, and for unknown reasons got out on a ramp leading from John Nolen Dr. onto the West Beltline Highway. The car's driver estimates he was going 25 mph at the time the passenger disembarked. Once out, the man ran into a traffic lane. A SUV driver saw him coming and slammed on the brakes, nearly coming to a stop, as the man ran into the side of the vehicle. He was down in the roadway when police arrived, and was transported to a hospital where his blood alcohol level measured .29. Neither driver was cited.
