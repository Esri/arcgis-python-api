  A MPD officer used a football-style tackle to take down a 57-year-old man Sunday night after negations failed to get the suspect to give himself up peacefully. Multiple officers set up a perimeter after responding to a Fieldwood Road home following domestic violence where a female victim had a gun pointed at her. She had also been physically assaulted. The man came outside briefly, but refused to show his hands. He swore at officers, and was about to reenter the home when the tackle was made. The suspect fought with police before being taken into custody. Released 11/14/2016 at 12:02 PM by PIO Joel Despain
