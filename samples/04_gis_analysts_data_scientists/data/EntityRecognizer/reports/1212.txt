 Two 13-year-old boys were walking home from the Orton Park Festival last night when a tan minivan pulled up near them in the 1000 block of Spaight St. The boys said the driver opened an automatic sliding door on the passenger side while asking if they were "looking for a ride." Both felt very uncomfortable, and told the man, "no." They hurried to one of their homes and told a parent who called police. Officers were not able to locate the van or the driver.
