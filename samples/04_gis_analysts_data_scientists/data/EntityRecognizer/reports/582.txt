A Madison Police Officer was conducting a traffic stop on University Avenue near Campus Drive. As the officer had completed his traffic stop with the individual he pulled over, the officer was walking back to his squad when the driver of another vehicle struck the officer's squad from behind, which caused the squad to then hit the car the officer had conducted the traffic stop on. There were no injuries to anyone, and the driver who struck the squad and the other vehicle was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while impaired(1st offense), and failure to yield.
