 The MPD is investigating a pair of similar smash-and-grab style burglaries that took place at West Towne Mall over the weekend. One was called in early Saturday morning; the other early Sunday morning. In both crimes rocks were used to break out windows, providing the intruder/intruders access into the mall. On Saturday, a burglar broke out more glass at the Apple Store and took several cell phones. On Sunday, a kiosk business's safe was smashed open and contents contained therein stolen. Detectives believe the crimes are likely connected.  Released 05/15/2017 at 9:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
