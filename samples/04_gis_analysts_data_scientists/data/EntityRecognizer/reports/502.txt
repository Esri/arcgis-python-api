The MPD is investigating a rash of graffiti and tagging incidents that took place overnight around Williamson and Jenifer Streets. A witness called 911 around 12:45 a.m. after seeing two young men spray painting some construction equipment. They fled as police arrived. Investigators found red and blue spray paint on numerous items to include road signs, construction barricades, heavy equipment, a portable toilet, an electrical box, and a construction trailer. It was dark when the officer was conducting his survey, and more damage was expected to be observed during the light of day. Released 06/10/2016 at 10:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
