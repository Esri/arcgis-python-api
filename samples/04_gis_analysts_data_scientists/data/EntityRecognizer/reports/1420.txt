An estimated 7,000 attended the Mifflin Street Block Party this afternoon: approximately half the number of partygoers as compared to last year. Snow and rain likely contributed to the lower number of partygoers.  Most people were well behaved.  Approximately 16 people were cited and released for infractions for drinking on the street or sidewalk, underage drinking, trespass, disorderly conduct and urinating in public.  71 people were arrested at the 2018 Mifflin Event.  The Madison Police Department would like to thank the Madison Fire Department, the Dane County Sheriff's Office, Dane County 911 and additional city partners for the assistance in keeping the event safe.  Released 04/27/2019 at 5:08 PM by PIO Lorie Anderson
