A 16 year old and a 17 yr old female were heading back to their vehicles after a soccer event at James Madison Memorial High School.  As they neared one of their vehicles in the parking lot, a silver color sedan pulled up and a black male exited with a handgun, pointing it at one of the girls, demanding the keys to her vehicle.  The girl complied, and the suspect took her vehicle and sped off northbound on Gammon Rd along with the silver sedan.  No shots were fired during the incident, and there were no reported injuries.
