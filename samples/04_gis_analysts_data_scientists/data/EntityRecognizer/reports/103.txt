 A concerned caller told police a driver fired some type of weapon out of a moving car around 8:00 p.m. last night causing other motorists to take evasive actions near the intersection of Wisconsin Ave. and E. Gorham St. The witness thought it might have been fireworks. No one was hurt, and officers determined the likely suspect was someone being sought for making threats the day prior.  On the Fourth of July, around 11:00 p.m. witnesses said Andrew M. Stoltz, age 20, Middleton, was armed with a flare gun when he threatened people during a confrontation on Camden Rd. The victims are people he knows. Several hours after last night's weapon's violation, a MPD officer saw the car Stoltz was driving burst through a chain-link fence in the 700 block of Regent St. It proceeded west in the eastbound lanes of Regent St. The officer next saw the car hop a curb, go over a terrace and onto East Campus Mall. The suspect was then spotted around 3:00 a.m. driving in the 700 block of State St. where pedestrians normally walk. The MPD did not chase the car, and it ended up at a dead-end near the Center for Limnology, 680 N. Park St. The suspect ran, but was quickly located by the MPD and UW-Madison Police. He is facing numerous tentative charges, some of which are listed above. Both UW-Madison Police and Shorewood Hills Police will likely have additional counts. The MPD thanks officers from both partner agencies for assisting in bringing a peaceful end to the night's crime spree.       Released 07/06/2018 at 10:55 AM by PIO Joel Despain
