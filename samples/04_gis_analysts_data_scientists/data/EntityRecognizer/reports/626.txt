A gas station clerk hit a panic button sending a would-be robber out of the Shell, 3401 University Ave., empty-handed early this morning. The man had ordered the employee to give him all of the money in the till. He did so while holding a hand in a pocket as if he might have a weapon. Instead of producing cash, the clerk summoned help. Officers and a police dog arrived but no suspect was located.  Released 04/13/2016 at 10:24 AM by PIO Joel Despain
