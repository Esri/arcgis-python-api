A suspect walked into the Regent St. Liquor Store armed with a handgun and demanded money from the clerk.  The suspect got an undisclosed amount of cash and then forced the two employees into a back room where he told them to wait five minutes before calling the police.  When police arrived on scene, a K-9 track was attempted, but was unable to locate the suspect.  The investigation is on-going at this time.
