 A 21-year-old Madison woman needed nine stitches to close a facial cut after she and a girlfriend were both punched in the face by the same man early Sunday morning. The women said they were conversing on State St. when the suspect approached and tried to speak with them. They told him to move along, and said that is when he punched the first woman – the one who ended up needing medical treatment. The second woman went to her friend's aid, and that is when she was also struck in the head. The man fled; however was later arrested after the victims were able to point him out on a social media site. They said he is a friend of a friend but that they do not know him.
