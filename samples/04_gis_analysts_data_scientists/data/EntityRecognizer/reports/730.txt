On 5/28/2018, Madison Police were alerted to a subject who had made some threats to harm himself; near the 3800 block of East Washington Avenue.  Police developed information that the male subject had recently entered a heavily wooded area, and due to the dense terrain, limited ability to see, and infestation of biting mosquitos, The Madison Police Department activated the UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System); as that seemed to be the best alternative to get a better view of both the area and a potentially hiding subject. The pilot deployed the UAS, and began to pick up a heat signature, emanating from a specific location in the wooded area.  The officer knew that specific information was fairly consistent with a human body, and after this information was determined, officers were able to focalize on an area, near the quarry, where the sought party was located.  Officers were able to specifically move to the area of the hiding subject, and then arrange for the necessary resources to aid/assist that subject who was located. The use of UAS's help to augment the abilities of police to actively perform a variety of tasks; tasks that would otherwise pose substantial risks to officers. They also afford the opportunity to obtain critical investigatory information, to further cases that are involved in by the police department.  Missing person's cases, pursuing fleeing suspects, and aerial overviews of crime scenes, are just a few of the limitless tasks that a UAS program can afford police. The Madison Police Department will continue to work relentlessly to improve both the equipment and training of the FAA Certified Remote Pilots who currently work for the department, as this is yet another tool that helps to keep the community safe.
