 Two teenage boys – ages 15 and 13 - were counseled about the danger of possessing a look-alike weapon after they were seen displaying an airsoft gun on S. Park St. Tuesday afternoon. When officers contacted the teens, one had the weapon – which looks something like an AK-47 - in his backpack. It was confiscated by the officer.    Released 03/01/2018 at 9:39 AM by PIO Joel Despain
