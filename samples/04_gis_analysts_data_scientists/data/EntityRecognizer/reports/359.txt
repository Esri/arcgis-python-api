This morning, the Dane County Narcotics Task Force, working with DEA and ATF agents, seized nearly $80,000 worth of cocaine (973.9 grams), more than $18,000 cash, and other evidence related to drug peddling, following a months-long investigation into high-level cocaine trafficking. Two suspects, returning from Illinois, were taken into custody during a traffic stop between Stoughton and Oregon. Cocaine was found in their vehicle. Shortly after the apprehensions, detectives and agents executed a search warrant the primary suspect's (see Almazan above) home: 323 N. Main St., Oregon, WI. More cocaine and cash were collected from the residence. In the run-up to today's activities, an undercover officer purchased cocaine many times from Almazan at various Madison locations.  Released 01/07/2016 at 2:20 PM by PIO Joel Despain
