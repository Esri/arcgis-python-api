 What started as a play fight in the cafeteria escalated into a real fight yesterday afternoon at Memorial High School, 201 S. Gammon Rd. A 17-year-old student received a head cut that required stitches. Another 17-year-old was arrested for substantial battery. Video shows the arrested teen throwing a punch at the victim and making a stomping motion towards the victim's head while he was on the ground. Released 01/23/2019 at 10:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
