 A S. Henry St. resident was about to enter her home last evening when she noticed there were lights on inside. She knew she had not left them on. She then noticed broken glass next to the front door and she quickly called 911. Just then, a stranger carrying her television and her kitchen trashcan came out of her house. She yelled: "That's my stuff!" The burglar dropped her TV but fled with the garbage can. After officers cleared her residence, she was able to determine money, jewelry and 12 bottles of beer were gone. The items were likely inside the garbage can. Her garbage was scattered in a hallway. A propane tank from a gas grill was found near the broken window glass. Released 12/09/2016 at 10:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
