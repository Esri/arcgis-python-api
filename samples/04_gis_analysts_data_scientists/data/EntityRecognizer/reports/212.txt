Central District detectives have identified, but not yet arrested a suspect following an assault and robbery that took place in an alleyway off of State Street last Wednesday night. A 39-year-old Chicago woman suffered significant facial injuries after being battered. She told investigators she met a man in the downtown area and had been socializing with him. She went with him to the alleyway, where he ended up attacking and robbing the woman of her cash and cell phone. The suspect is currently in the Dane County Jail having been arrested in a different case. The case detective in the alleyway assault plans to refer tentative charges to the District Attorney in the near future. Surveillance camera images proved instrumental in identifying a suspect.  Released 06/11/2019 at 10:47 AM by PIO Joel Despain
