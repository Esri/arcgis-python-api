Truettner, age 31, Madison is a suspect in close to 20 recent retail theft cases in multiple jurisdictions. He is believed to have been supporting a drug habit by walking out of stores with merchandise, in many cases television sets. Walmart, Target, Shopko, and Kohl's are among the retailers reporting losses. Truettner was arrested by Monona Police on Sunday night as he attempted to leave Walmart, 2151 Royal Ave., with a 55" television set. Released 01/30/2018 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
