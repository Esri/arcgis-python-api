A vehicle operated by Roberts crashed into a light pole on Cottage Grove Rd near Drexel Avenue, knocking the lights off and doing significant damage to the vehicle.  Airbags were deployed.  Roberts was then seen by MPD entering a vehicle operated by Trainor.  This vehicle was subsequently stopped, and Roberts was transported to an area hospital where he was treated for his injuries and arrested for OWI. After further investigation, Trainor was arrested for OWI as well for the operation of her vehicle during this incident.  Investigation is continuing. Released 01/20/2017 at 4:44 AM by Lt.
