On 3/8/2018, shortly after 12:35am, officers were dispatched to the 3500 block of Straubel Street reference a disturbance involving a man in a tan & green suit.  The Dane County 911 Center had developed information that the probable suspect was attempting to drive away, and was thought to be intoxicated.  Officers arrived and contacted Milton Simmons, who described his interaction with a 36-year-old victim as a mere argument over a duffle bag that was inside his car.  Simmons made it clear that he was not going to relinquish the bag, under any circumstances, even though the victim had continually stated it was her property and was full of her clothing (formal dress/female undergarmets).  The officer suspected more than alcohol, upon his inspection of Simmons' vehicle, and requested a K9 come to his location.  Maple Bluff Police K9 "Ali" arrived promptly, and after a few sniffs, alerted that this vehicle contained more than a duffle bag of clothes.  Ali's keen nose gave way to entering the vehicle, officers finding Marijuana, and lastly being able to obtain the possessions of the victim.  Since Simmons refused to return the victim's property, officers took him into custody on the listed charge, and he was conveyed to the Dane County Jail.      PO Howard Payne  Released 03/09/2018 at 2:28 PM by P.O.
