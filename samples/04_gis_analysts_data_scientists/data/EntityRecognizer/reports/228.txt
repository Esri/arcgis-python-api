Officers are sent to Copps reference a male in the parking lot who was feeling suicidal.  The male told dispatch that he was going to light himself on fire.  When officers arrived on scene, they found the male holding an open can of gas and a lighter (while smoking a cigarette).  Officers began to dialogue with the male in an attempt to get him to put down the gas can and the lighter.  (Other officers were standing by with fire extinguishers and the fire department was staged nearby.)  Officers continued to negotiate with the male for approximately 30 minutes, but were unable to convince him to put down the gas can.  At this point, the male began to raise the gas can, as if to pour the gas on himself.  Seeing that the situation was about to get a lot worse, a sergeant on scene rushed the male and tackled him to the ground.  Other officers quickly assisted in taking the male into protective custody, potentially averting a tragedy.    Released 10/03/2016 at 4:06 AM by Sgt.
