 A crime victim kept a safe distance behind an armed robbery suspect while providing a 911 communicator details on his direction of travel, putting the MPD in position to make an arrest yesterday afternoon. The victim had his wallet picked from his pocket in the 100 block of State St. He yelled for the suspect to return it. The homeless man responded by ripping money from the wallet and throwing it to the ground. The victim retrieved his property and continued to follow the suspect, letting him know 911 was being called. At this point, the suspect pulled out a knife and threatened the victim. The victim continued to stay back, while at the same time keeping police up to speed on the suspect's movements.Officers arrived and arrested the man. He was taken to jail while the vigilant victim got his cash back.   Released 06/21/2017 at 10:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
