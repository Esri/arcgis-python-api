 A Green Avenue homeowner said the reports were so loud it sounded as if a gun was being fired right outside his living room window last evening. He dropped to the floor fearing he might be hit. In the darkness, responding officers recovered three shell casings in the roadway, but witnesses thought they heard as many as five shots. There were no immediate reports of injuries or property damage. Released 01/03/2018 at 9:38 AM by PIO Joel Despain
