 Our Burglary Crimes Unit has sent an email to several west side neighborhood organizations following an uptick in burglaries where criminals are entering open garages. Westmorland, Sunset Village, Midvale Heights, Nakoma and Hill Farms are among the targeted neighborhoods. Here is the message from the MPD's BCU: Hello: We wanted to reach out to some selected neighborhood associations to let you know of a recent increase in burglaries we've been seeing in your area.  Over the past two weeks we have received multiple reports of bicycles, items from vehicles and even vehicles being stolen out of garages.  These burglaries have occurred while the residents were home, sometimes during the late night/early morning hours.  Most of these cases involved open garage doors, allowing the criminals easy access to the items stolen.  At this point, it doesn't appear that entry was made to the house in any of these cases, but that is certainly a possibility as thieves get more emboldened.  Could you please remind your community members to be vigilant about making sure their garage door is closed when they are not in direct sight of it?  Also, please let them know that keeping a side or rear garage access door unlocked, puts them at risk for this type of burglary.  While we know it can sometimes be awkward, we really encourage people to reach out to their neighbors and let them know if their garage door has been left open, especially at night.  Looking out for each other in this way can prevent a large number of burglaries and help keep the whole neighborhood safer.   Released 03/31/2016 at 2:49 PM by PIO Joel Despain
