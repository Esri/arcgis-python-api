 This morning, a 50-year-old Madison man turned himself into detectives from the MPD's Special Victims Unit following a sexual assault investigation. The MPD received information last month regarding a teenager who now lives in another state. The victim had recently disclosed - to a trusted adult - details regarding sexual assaults that took place five years ago when the child was 10-years-old. The suspect was one of the victim's teachers when the child attended Leopold Elementary School. Anyone with information is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608)266-6014.     Released 10/13/2017 at 3:03 PM by PIO Joel Despain
