 Slippery roads may have been a contributing factor in a serious SUV versus tree crash on Engelhart Dr. yesterday afternoon. A Madison mother was driving her three children home when she lost control of her Ford Explorer. She was not wearing a seatbelt and suffered a serious head injury. Her oldest daughter - the front seat passenger - is hospitalized with broken bones. The younger daughter suffered a possible concussion, and the son was released to other family members having not been seriously injured. The crash is under investigation by a MPD Traffic Specialist.
