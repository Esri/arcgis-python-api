 Multiple concerned callers said they all heard the same thing last night: three gunshots being fired in the 2100 block of Luann Lane. A South District officer was parked not far away. He had his window down and was working on reports. The officer also heard the reports. He and others from the MPD responded. They spoke with many who heard the same thing; however, no casings or other evidence could immediately be located. Released 10/10/2018 at 9:08 AM by PIO Joel Despain
