The MPD is seeking your help in identifying a downtown burglar. The surveillance photo was taken last evening inside a back hallway of the Mad Seafood Boiler restaurant, 201 W. Gorham St. The intruder came in a backdoor and stole an employee's coat containing car keys. The thief then found the employee's car, rifled through it, and stole some cash. Restaurant employees believe the same man committed a similar crime at Mad Seafood Boiler this past Sunday. Anyone with information on his identity is asked to call Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.  Released 10/24/2018 at 11:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
