 A man was kicked, kneed and punched while being attacked by two acquaintances on Wisconsin Ave. last night. The victim's girlfriend was also kicked during the violence. One suspect pulled out a box cutter, but it was not used to cut either victim. The suspects fled the area as police were called, and were later located and arrested.
