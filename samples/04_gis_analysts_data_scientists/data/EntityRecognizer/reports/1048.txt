 Three Madison teens - connected to a mini-crime spree - were arrested following foot chases near West Towne Mall Wednesday afternoon. On Tuesday morning, a 61-year-old Welton Drive resident awoke to find his pickup truck had been stolen from his driveway. Wednesday morning, one that looked like it was seen in the parking lot of Attic Angel, 8301 Old Sauk Rd. around the time a staff member had her purse stolen from her car. A short time later, around 11:55 a.m., a 33-year-old Black Earth mother was pumping gas at the Mobil gas station, 33 Junction Court, while keeping an eye on her baby who was in a child seat. The mom thought nothing of it when a similarly described pickup parked at the pump across from her location. Two young men got out, and the truck left without anyone pumping gas into it. The victim thought that odd, and then discovered her wallet had been taken from the front seat of her car. A 64-year-old woman had the same crime happen to her a half-hour later when she was filling her tank at another Mobil gas station, 8230 Watts Rd. Someone swiped her purse from the front seat. Moments later, the stolen pickup was found parked near West Towne Mall. A bag belonging to the Attic Angel victim was inside and officers were soon on the trail of suspects, all of whom were arrested following foot pursuits. They have been connected to the series of crimes and taken to the Juvenile Reception Center.  Released 10/12/2017 at 10:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
