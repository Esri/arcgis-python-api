 The MPD was called to a downtown tavern early this morning after a patron pulled a handgun from his waistband - and wracked the slide - during an argument. The man was still seated in the Main Depot, 627 W. Main St., when officers arrived. He was no longer armed, but an Airsoft gun - which looked like a real weapon - was found in his car. He was arrested and taken to jail. Released 03/17/2016 at 9:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
