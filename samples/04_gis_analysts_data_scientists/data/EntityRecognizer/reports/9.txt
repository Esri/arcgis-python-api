 An 83-year-old Pine St. resident died Sunday evening after becoming trapped beneath a wheel of his car. The hood was up, and it appeared the victim was working on it when it began to roll from his driveway towards the street. It's believed he was trying to stop the car when the accident occurred. A neighbor told police the victim was having parking brake trouble and had been placing a block of wood under a tire to prevent it from rolling. Released 06/05/2017 at 10:34 AM by PIO Joel Despain
