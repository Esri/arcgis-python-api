 A Madison man suffered serious cuts to his head; a hand and a wrist after being hit over the head with a beer bottle during a bar fight early this morning. The victim and another man had been arguing over a woman when things got physical inside the Jade Monkey, 109 Cottage Grove Rd. Witnesses said the victim collapsed after being struck with the bottle, and that the suspect continued punching him as both men were on the floor, which was now laden with shattered glass. A bartender also was cut while helping pull the men apart. The suspect fled as police were called. The victim required numerous sutures to close wounds, a couple of which cut tendons and nerves. He and the suspect are acquainted with one another. The suspect has yet to be located. Released 06/19/2017 at 2:29 PM by PIO Joel Despain
