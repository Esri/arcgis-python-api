 A dump truck driver called for police Monday afternoon after someone in a passing car shot at his passenger side window as he drove on U.S. Highway 151 near Nelson Rd. An officer thought the damage was likely caused by a pellet or a BB. The window, which had a small round impact area surrounded by spider webbing, shattered and fell to the ground as the victim and the officer were inspecting it.
