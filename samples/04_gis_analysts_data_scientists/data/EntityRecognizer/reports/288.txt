A woman was struck in the back of the head with a bottle and then repeatedly punched and kicked outside of an E. Washington Ave. gas station Friday evening. Witnesses told police the man battering the victim was asking if she had "his money." She said the man also tried to strike her with a gas pump nozzle, and ended up squirting gasoline on her. She was transported to a hospital with a head cut. The suspect and an accomplice drove away before police arrived. The victim told officers she is acquainted with the accomplice, but not the suspect.  Released 01/04/2016 at 11:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
