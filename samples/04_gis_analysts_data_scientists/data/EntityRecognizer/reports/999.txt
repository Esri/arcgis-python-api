A 42-year-old Oregon, WI, man was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while impaired causing great bodily harm, and for possession of a narcotic (fentanyl) following a three car Sunday morning crash that injured seven on East Washington Ave. An eyewitness told police the suspect was driving around 40 mph, heading outbound on East Washington, when he failed to stop for a red light at Zeier Rd. The witness said the suspect's car rear-ended another that was stopped. The impact sent the suspect's car airborne. While in the air, it spun and landed upside down on a third car. None of the injuries were life-threatening.  Released 04/08/2019 at 11:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
