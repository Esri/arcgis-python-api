 The MPD responded to the 5200 block of Camden Rd. last night after a caller thought shots had been fired. When officers arrived, they determined that was not the case. They found two Madison teens who had been battered by other young men, some of whom have had an ongoing dispute with the victims. The victims were not seriously injured, but the car in which they were traveling had its windows broken out by a baseball bat. Several of the attackers were reportedly armed with bats, and one victim said he was struck by one. The other victim said he was hit with a pipe. Both were also punched and kicked.
