The witness went outside and yelled at the young burglars, telling them to drop the television. Realizing their daytime break-in had been spotted; they did drop the TV, jumped a fence, and ran off. MPD was unable to locate suspects, but officers did find a door to the burglarized home damaged from being forced open. Released 02/17/2017 at 10:52 AM by PIO Joel Despain
