East District detectives are seeking potential leads after several parked vehicles were damaged by BB or pellet gunfire over the past couple of weeks. A Valley Road homeowner reported a shattered passenger side window to her Jeep on November 8th. It had been parked outside her residence, and a witness heard a noise around 11:30 p.m. the night prior that could have been related. On November 2nd, two vehicles parked in the 5000 block of Starker Ave. were found to have been struck by BBs or pellets in a similar fashion, causing small impact dents and window damage. Anyone with information on these cases is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.  Released 11/12/2018 at 2:50 PM by PIO Joel Despain
