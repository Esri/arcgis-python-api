A UW-Madison student contacted the MPD Monday regarding a strong-armed robbery that took place last month. The victim said the perpetrator appeared to be homeless, and she originally did not report the crime because she felt sorry for the woman. Others compelled her to now report what happened. She was walking on the Southwest Commuter Path, near N. Orchard St., on the night of January 13th, a Sunday. The robber ran up to her: "Do you have any money?" The victim said the woman "sounded sad." She told her she had no cash and that's when the woman's demeanor changed. She became angry, placed a hand in a pocket, as if she might have a weapon. "I really need you to give me your money," she demanded. At this point the student gave her what she had. The robber then wanted to see the young woman's phone. At this point, the victim decided to run, and made it safely home. She was able to look back to see the robber was now talking with a man, who must have been somewhere nearby at the time of the crime. Released 02/19/2019 at 10:06 AM by PIO Joel Despain
