 A Madison teen – picked up just last month for a similar break-in - has been arrested for smash-and-grab style business burglaries, and detectives believe he could be connected to other similar crimes in the West Towne and Odana Rd. areas. The teen was taken into custody over the weekend for an unrelated theft case and was found to be in possession of items stolen early Saturday morning from a pair of Odana Rd. stores. Mad Vapor, 6661 Odana Rd., and Tech Plus, 6614 Odana Rd., were both burglarized after front door glass was smashed out. The suspect was previously arrested in late April for a smash-and-grab burglary a Dick's Sporting Goods. He was allegedly trying to steal look-alike guns from the West Towne store.     Released 05/22/2017 at 12:39 PM by PIO Joel Despain
