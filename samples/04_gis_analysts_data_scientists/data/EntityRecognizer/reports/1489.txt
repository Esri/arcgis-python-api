 Criminals passed several fake $100 bills at West Towne Mall Sunday. The MPD was called to Gap Kids after a man successfully bought a $20 gift card - and got $80 in change - after giving a clerk a counterfeit $100 bill. Employees at Jamboree said a woman - around the same time frame - tried to hand them a phony $100 to buy some clothing. They were able to determine the bill was counterfeit and the woman left. Later in the day, an assistant manager at American Eagle Outfitters was counting money in the tills and found two fake $100 bills. All accepted bogus bills had the same serial number: JT12750055A.
