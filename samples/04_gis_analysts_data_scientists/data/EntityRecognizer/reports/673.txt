On April 1, 1997, a Madison Police Officer was dispatched to the 2700 block of Milwaukee Street to investigate the complaint of a barking dog.  After completing an investigation of the area, the alleged barking dog could not be located. On April 1, 2019, the same officer checked the same area and found the same result; no barking dog.  A supplemental report was filed under the original case number. The original call in 1997 was the officer's first call as a solo patrol officer.  The follow-up investigation in 2019 was the officer' last call as a solo patrol officer.  Now departing the Madison Police department in favor of retirement, that same officer would like to thank the residents of Madison and his colleagues for a remarkable career and a lifetime of memories. Farewell, be safe and be kind to one another. David J Dexheimer, badge number 2701  Released 04/01/2019 at 2:22 PM by PIO Joel Despain
