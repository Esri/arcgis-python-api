 Central District detectives are investigating a series of early Sunday morning batteries that took place inside a W. Gorham St. apartment building, and later - on a sidewalk - in the 200 block of W. Gilman St. The preliminary investigation indicates the same suspects could be responsible for the violence. Detectives have strong leads and are in the process of identifying the two or three men they believe are likely culpable. At the first scene, five young men were punched and attacked in a hallway following an argument between the suspects and a couple of the victims. Later in the morning, around 4:30 a.m., a 22-year-old Madison man was knocked unconscious by one suspect after the stranger asked to hug the victim's girlfriend. The victim refused to let that happen and he was punched. He suffered a broken nose and concussion. In the first set of batteries two victims facial fractures. Apartment building surveillance video shows one of the suspects battering people randomly following an initial disagreement with a couple of residents. The suspects do not live in the building, and may have come from another county to party in Madison.    Released 09/21/2016 at 3:35 PM by PIO Joel Despain
