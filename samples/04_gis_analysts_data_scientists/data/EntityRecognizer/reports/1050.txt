A father and his two young children narrowly escaped injury when a drunken driver reversed her car into the living room of their Ondossagon Way home Sunday morning. Flying debris knocked the father out of his recliner. His infant daughter was in a "jumper" chair and was just two to three feet from where the car finally stopped. His older daughter, who is two, was about ten feet away at the kitchen table. Just prior to the collision, concerned neighbors on nearby Madeline Island had called for an ambulance after finding the driver asleep in the locked and running car. They had tried to wake her, and she finally came around just as the ambulance arrived. The driver put the car in reverse and drove quickly across a yard, over playground equipment, before impacting the home on Ondossagon Way. Inside, the shaken father suffered a stubbed toe, but no one else was injured. The intoxicated motorist was arrested for second degree reckless endangerment and second offense drunken driving.  Released 10/22/2018 at 9:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
