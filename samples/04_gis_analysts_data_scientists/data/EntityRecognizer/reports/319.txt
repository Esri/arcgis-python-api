 The MPD was called to a Brentwood Parkway apartment Friday morning after a resident awakened to find a window damaged by gunfire. Officers determined there had been at least two bullets shot at the building. One went through a living room window and lodged in a wall. The second was located in a metal window frame. Tenants of the damaged apartment did not hear anything overnight, but a neighbor thought he heard popping sounds around 3:00 a.m. It is not known if this was a random act of gun violence or if the residence was targeted for some reason.
