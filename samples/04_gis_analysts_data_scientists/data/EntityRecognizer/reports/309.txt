 A 21-year-old McFarland woman suffered minor facial cuts after the passenger window of the car in which she was traveling was kicked out early Tuesday morning. The incident occurred at the corner of Lake St. and State St. The victim believes the man responsible was someone she encountered downtown earlier in the night. She said he had come on to her, but she rejected his advances. No one in the car could provide a good description of the man. Released 09/06/2017 at 10:34 AM by PIO Joel Despain
