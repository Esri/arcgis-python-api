 A young mother, standing inside an East Washington bus stop with her baby in a stroller, was the victim of a strong-armed robbery Monday afternoon. The victim said two men demanded she hand over her wallet and phone. She was fearful of them and complied. They fled on foot and she went to a nearby business to call for help.
