 A concerned 47-year-old Madison man stopped female bicyclists from peddling into an area he had just come from after he saw a young man smiling and exposing himself on the Southwest Commuter Path Wednesday evening. The caller said the teen was near Lovell Lane and facing the bike path so anyone on it would see him. Police were unable to locate a suspect.   Released 08/11/2016 at 3:46 PM by PIO Joel Despain
