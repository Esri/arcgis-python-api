 A West High custodian called for police after hearing a loud boom early this morning. It sounded like it had come from the outside tennis courts, and that is where a significantly damaged car was found. It had crashed through a fence and dropped off an embankment onto the courts. One of its bumpers was in a Regent St. traffic lane. The car was empty, but utilizing its plates, officers were able to make contact with the owner. He was found injured, smelling of intoxicants, and asleep inside his Breeze Terrace residence. The suspect was taken to a hospital with a possible head injury. He denied being in a crash, and said something about falling down or being punched. The investigation is ongoing. Released 02/23/2016 at 11:00 AM by PIO Joel Despain
