She had her little girl in a baby seat, and was walking home along Lake Point Dr. this past Friday afternoon when two men attempted to convince the 21-year-old to get in their car. The woman said the men pulled up by her, with the passenger getting out and showing her a fat stack of cash. He said it was his birthday, that she should "trust him," and that he would pay for her. She said at one point he placed a hand on her upper back. The woman strongly told the men she was going nowhere with them, and leave her alone. She went home and called police. Officers were not able to locate men, who the victim did not know. Released 03/25/2019 at 11:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
