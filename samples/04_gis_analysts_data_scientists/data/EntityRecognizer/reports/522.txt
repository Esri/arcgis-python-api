A husband and wife were attacked outside of their Morraine View Dr. apartment building early Sunday morning. They were taking the trash out, and also wanted to make sure they had locked their SUV. The husband noticed one of its doors was open and a man was near it. He went to investigate. The stranger grabbed the husband and punched him in the head. The husband attempted to defend himself when a second man approached and stabbed him in the forearm with some type of sharp object. The husband yelled for his wife to call police. As she did, one of the men also delivered blows to her face. The thieves fled with an iPod from the couple's SUV. Officers found a broken bottle with apparent blood on it, and believed it to be the weapon used in the stabbing. Madison Fire Department paramedics treated the husband's two puncture wounds.
