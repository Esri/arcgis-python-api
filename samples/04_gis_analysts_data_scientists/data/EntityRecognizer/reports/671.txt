 A Madison man was duped out of $10,400 last month after falling for a common IRS scam. A caller with a foreign accent told the victim he would be immediately arrested if he did not stay on the phone and make good on back taxes that were owed to the government. The victim later told the MPD all he could think about was his baby and his wife and how he feared the possibility of inadvertent mistakes in past tax filings. Over the course of several hours, he stayed on the phone with the crook, going to different locations to purchase iTunes cards while also wiring cash to "Auditors Company Alliance Group LLC." Before the ordeal was over, he also sent a photocopy of his driver's license to the scam artist. When he started to get that sinking feeling, he attempted to call the man back, but the phone number (715-703-8896) was no longer in service. Released 07/06/2016 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
