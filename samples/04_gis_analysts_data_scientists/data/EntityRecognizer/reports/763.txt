 A W. Gilman St. residence was in his bedroom Saturday afternoon, having a sandwich and watching Netflix, when he heard some noise coming from another room. He thought nothing of it, figuring it was a roommate. That was until his door opened and a stranger's head popped in. "(Expletive), I'm out of here," said the intruder as he realized the home he had targeted was occupied. The renter quickly contacted his roommates. One, a 22-year-old woman, determined her laptop, purse, backpack and other items had been stolen. The investigating officer found a screen on the ground that had been removed from a first floor window. Although the door to the home was locked, it was an unsecured window that provided a daytime burglar access. The MPD is reviewing area surveillance video and are hoping to identify him.
