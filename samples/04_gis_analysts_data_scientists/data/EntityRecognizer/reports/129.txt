The Madison Police Department is currently investigating a significant traffic crash on the Beltline (Hwy 12) between Park St and Fish Hatchery Rd..  At this time all westbound traffic on the Beltline is being diverted at Park St and there is only one open lane eastbound.  It is expected that this traffic situation will remain for at least a few hours while the investigation and cleanup takes place, likely causing significant traffic delays.  Motorists are advised to avoid this area if possible.
