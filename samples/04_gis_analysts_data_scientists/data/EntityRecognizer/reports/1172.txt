 A 21-year-old Madison woman lost consciousness after being choked by a stranger while she was outside with friends in the 600 block of University Ave. early Friday morning. The suspect had tried to "photobomb" - insert himself in a photo - the victim and her friends were taking. He then talked about how much his clothing cost and how much money he had. At one point, he pulled out a wad of cash and tossed some bills - including a couple of $100's - in the air. One of the victim's friends picked up a couple of them; however, the suspect now wanted it all back. The bills were returned, but for some reason he became enraged with the victim. He attacked her, placing both hands around her neck while shaking the victim's head. After regaining consciousness, she fled the area with friends, and did not immediately contact police. The MPD was notified of the violence later in the morning, and a detective is now in the process of trying to identify a suspect. Released 09/18/2017 at 12:07 PM by PIO Joel Despain
