Officers responded to the disturbance, and immediately located Herbert Wilkins, a subject who had been described as wearing an orange shirt.  Witnesses stated that Wilkins was the sole participant in the disturbance call, as he was said to be obstructing the sidewalk and refusing to allow pedestrians to move past his body without grabbing them.  Madison Firefighters could see Wilkins' behavior from the nearby fire station, and they would quickly become the focus of Wilkins' indignant statements and behaviors. Wilkins walked over to the fire fighters, and started to make "Racially charged" statements; all while he continued to yell and poked them in the chest.  Officers attempted to contact Wilkins, but he decided to run.  Officers pursued Wilkins, and even threatened to use an ECD (Electronic Control Device)/Taser; based on his level of cooperation.  Wilkins attempted to run around a vehicle, but between miscalculating his movements, and having his pants fall down to his knees, he ended up running into a stationary car.  Officers quickly took Wilkins into custody on all charges listed, but Wilkins continued to threaten police and emergency workers.  He made threats to kill responding personnel and their families, all while spewing bodily fluids from his mouth. PO Howard Payne       Released 08/11/2017 at 11:48 AM by P.O.
