At approximately 3:55 pm on today's date Madison Police Department officers were dispatched to the area of Upham St. and North St. regarding a disturbance call. While en route, officers were provided with an update through Dispatch indicating that the complainant in this call had been physically assaulted by the suspect. Upon arrival, officers were informed that the suspect had left the area. Officers began to canvass the immediate vicinity and the suspect was spotted. The suspect then fled from the officers on foot. As the officers got closer to the suspect, he presented a knife and made a threat. One of the officers subsequently shot the suspect. The suspect went down and first aid was rendered. MFD responded to the scene and the suspect, a white male, 35 years of age, was conveyed to a local hospital for what is believed to be a non-life threatening wound. Pursuant to MPD policy and consistent with State law, an independent investigating authority has been summoned as the primary agency in examining the officers' conduct and will investigate the officer involved shooting. The Department of Criminal Investigation (DCI) has agreed to respond and will take the case.   Chief Koval will be at Demetral Park at 6:30 pm for a brief update.
