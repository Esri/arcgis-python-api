 A motorist told the MPD he was involved in a bit of possible road rage Sunday night – possibly cutting off another driver - just prior to his rear driver's side rear window being shot out on N. Fish Hatchery Rd. He said the other car was an older light blue sedan, and the shot came as it passed. The gunfire occurred just after a shooting on S. Park St. (see Incident Report #2017-32977). Because of time and proximity, members of the Violent Crimes Unit will be looking to see if this case and the S. Park St. case might be linked in some way.
