A 23-year-old Madison woman was sentenced to four years probation this week and ordered not to have contact with pets or small animals after pleading guilty in Dane County Circuit Court to drowning a family's rabbit, named Oreo. The defendant was a guest in a Madison home where Oreo was a much loved pet. She admitted to intentionally submerging Oreo in a kitchen sink for several minutes. The MPD takes seriously the mistreatment of animals, and a West District detective was assigned the case following Oreo's death on March 28th of this year. Following sentencing, a West District lieutenant let the case detective know her dedication and due diligence are much appreciated: "Thank you for pursuing this case. I am glad she will be held responsible for the death of Oreo the rabbit. It is very significant that she will not be allowed to be around small animals for the next several years."   Released 11/17/2016 at 1:32 PM by PIO Joel Despain
