 A 40-year-old Madison man was visibly shaken last evening when officers arrived to take his statement at the South Transfer Point, 802 W. Badger Rd. The victim said an intoxicated man was drinking from a bottle of alcohol and had asked him for a cigarette and money. The victim told the suspect he did not need money if he could afford a bottle of booze. The suspect responded by pulling a long knife from his jacket and threatening the victim. The frightened man immediately called 911. The suspect was found to be in possession of one 12-inch knife and another that measured seven-inches. He was arrested for disorderly conduct while armed and carrying a concealed weapon.  Released 05/01/2019 at 10:05 AM by PIO Joel Despain
