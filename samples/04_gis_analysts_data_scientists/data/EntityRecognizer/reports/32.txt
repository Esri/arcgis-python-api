On Monday afternoon MPD officers were dispatched to a downtown laundromat after receiving a complaint of a patron inside the laundromat exposing himself. When officers arrived they located Hilsenhoff inside of the laundromat. Hilsenhoff was not wearing any pants or underwear and his lower body was exposed. The suspect, Hilsenhoff, told officers that he was in the laundromat washing his pants and underwear. Officers arrested Hilsenhoff, and he was booked into the Dane County Jail on a tentative charge of public indecency.   Released 06/24/2019 at 3:20 PM by P.O. Joseph Buccellato
