At 4:48am, on June 13th, 2018, The Dane County 911 Center dispatched officers to 402 West Gorham Street reference an intrusion alarm.  Officers arrived, and noticed the front entryway was completely shattered, with vast amounts of glass on the ground.  A perimeter was established, and announcements were made to any individual(s) inside to surrender.  A MPD K9 was sent into the building, but didn't locate anyone. After review of video surveillance footage, the suspect is seen attempting to force entry on the door by using his shoulder and feet.  When that was unsuccessful, he resorted to breaking the glass with a larger rock.   After entering, he immediately went to the cash register, taking an undisclosed amount of US Currency, and he took approximately 7 bottles of alcohol; estimated in value of $87.00.  The suspect seems to likely be a male/black with a lighter skin tone, and is probably between 5'10-6'00 in height and an average build.  The suspect was wearing a sweatshirt that had some indistinguishable writing on the front/back, and was also wearing blue jeans.  He also may have been wearing Adidas shoes with distinctive stripes on the side.  If anyone has any information about this case, they are encouraged to contact the Madison Police Department as soon as possible.  PO Howard Payne  Released 06/13/2018 at 11:46 AM by P.O.
