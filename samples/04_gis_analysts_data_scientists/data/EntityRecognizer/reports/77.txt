 Officers responded to a Chicago Ave. address Friday afternoon for a report of a man who had been stabbed. The victim was outside of his home. He had a laceration to his chest and hand and was transported to a hospital for the non-life-threatening injuries. The 22-year-old had more than $1,500 in his pocket and provided a couple of different scenarios as to how he came to be injured. Officers were not able to establish a crime scene, and they could not find surveillance video that supported any version of events provided by the victim.
