 A frightened Madison woman called the MPD Saturday morning after a teenager pointed a gun at her during a road-rage incident that occurred as both were exiting the West Beltline Highway onto S. Whitney Way. The victim said the teen wanted her to provide some room so he could move into the same lane she was utilizing, but she couldn't do it because there were vehicles close to her front and rear. Frustrated the teen rolled down his window and yelled out several times, B move!" He was aiming a black handgun at her while repeatedly barking out the order. The white crossover the teen was driving, as described by the victim, matches one that is on the MPD's most recent hot sheet of stolen cars. Released 05/13/2019 at 3:35 PM by PIO Joel Despain
