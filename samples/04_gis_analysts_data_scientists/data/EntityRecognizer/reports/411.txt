 The driver of a getaway car was arrested early this morning after bullets were fired at a home on Greenwich Dr. A family was inside at the time, and one round did strike a basement window, but thankfully there were no injuries. A car was seen leaving the area and it was later spotted on Whitney Way, merging onto the West Beltline Highway. Officers followed, at a distance, until attempting to pull the car over near Todd Drive. The suspect did not stop and led police from the West Beltline, to Fish Hatchery Rd., to Greenway Cross, to Traceway Dr., to Post Rd., to Syene Rd., to McCoy Rd, to County MM, to Oregon Rd., and then on to Deer Valley Rd. Finally on Pheasant Ridge Trail the suspect decided to stop. As he did, one passenger – possibly the gunman - fled on foot. The driver and a couple of others stayed put. The preliminary investigation indicates this was a targeted act of violence, and the MPD is looking to identify the fleeing passenger. Anyone with information is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 09/02/2016 at 10:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
