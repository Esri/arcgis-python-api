 Some callers reported a possible two-car crash; others were calling in a possible fight. All were contacting 911 about the same incident that was taking place on the W. Beltline Highway early Sunday morning. When officers arrived, they found just one damaged car and a pair of woman's sandals which were in the roadway. Running a data check on the car, they were able to link it to an address in the 5100 block of Great Gray Dr. from which there had just been a call to 911 that disconnected. Officers responded to the address and found an injured 21-year-old woman and the suspect. She told police they have had a past relationship, and that he had chased her at 80 mph as both drove the Beltline. The suspect used his car to ram the victim's car, forcing her off the highway. He then parked his car, got out, and threw her to the pavement where she was battered and choked. The suspect took her car keys, leaving her no choice but to get in his car and go to his home, which is where she was rescued by police. Released 09/11/2017 at 12:28 PM by PIO Joel Despain
