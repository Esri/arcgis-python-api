MPD Officers were dispatched to Packers Ave just north of International Ln for malfunctioning railroad crossing gates.  It appears as if a snowplow inadvertently sheared a junction box causing the gates to be stuck in the downward position.  Officers assisted with traffic control while an employee from the Canadian Pacific Railroad responded and fixed the problem.  All northbound and southbound traffic was closed on Packers Ave for several hours.
