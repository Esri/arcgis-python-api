    "\n",
    "[ArcGIS Network Analyst](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/networks/what-is-network-analyst-.htm) helps organizations run their operations more efficiently and improve strategic decision making by performing analysis on the travel costs between their facilities and demand locations to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the quickest way to get from point A to point B?\n",
    "* What houses are within five minutes of our fire stations?\n",
    "* What markets do our businesses cover?\n",
    "* Where should we open a new branch of our business to maximize market share?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these questions, ArcGIS Network Analyst creates origin-destination (OD) cost matrices along a travel network such as roads, to find solutions to reduce the overall costs of travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](http://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/notebooks/nbimages/04_als_odcost.png)\n",

    "### Location-Allocation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of [location-allocation](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/networks/location-allocation-analysis-layer.htm) is to locate facilities in a way that supplies the demand points most efficiently.  As the name suggests, location-allocation is a two-fold problem that simultaneously locates facilities and allocates demand points to the facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](http://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/notebooks/nbimages/04_als_location_allocation_schematic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `solve_location_allocation` tool\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the [solve_location_allocation](http://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/apidoc/html/arcgis.network.analysis.html#solve-location-allocation) tool to find the best locations for new ALS clinics in California.  Inputs to this tool include [FeatureSet](http://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/apidoc/html/arcgis.features.toc.html#featureset)s containing the following data:\n",
    "* facilities\n",
    "* demand points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples in this notebook, the facilities are a set of candidate locations for new ALS clinics.  These locations could be actual addresses.  However, for these examples, the candidate locations are cities that could potentially host new ALS clinics and are represented by their centroid points. The candidate cities were pre-selected based on the following criteria:\n",
    "* they are within California\n",
    "* they are outside of the 90 minute drive time areas from existing ALS clinics\n",
    "* they have populations of at least 60,000, and are therefore assumed to have sufficient health care facilities and professionals to support an ALS clinic\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyses in this notebook could lead to further multi-criteria analysis to identify specific  locations within a city or other geographic area.  For examples of Jupyter Notebooks with multi-criteria suitability analysis see [Calculating cost surfaces using weighted overlay analysis](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/calculating-cost-surfaces-using-weighted-overlay-analysis/) and [Finding suitable spots for placing heart defibrillator equipments in public](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/finding-suitable-spots-for-aed-devices-using-raster-analytics/)\n",

    "For the demand points, we will use point locations of fictional ALS patients.  These locations are aggregated to zip code centroids and contain an estimated number of ALS patients based on the total population within each zip code.\n",

    "* output_demand_points (`FeatureSet`)\n",
    "* output_allocation_lines (`FeatureSet`)\n",
    "\n",
