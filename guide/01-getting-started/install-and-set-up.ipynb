    "[Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) is the official packaging tool for managing environments and installing packages from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). To install the ArcGIS API for Python from PyPI in a new environment, create a new folder named `your-folder`. Open a terminal, and run `cd /path/to/your-folder` to change directories into `your-folder`. Then, enter the following command to simultaneously create a new environment and install the API in it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pipenv install arcgis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this command, you will notice that a new file named `Pipfile` was created in `your-folder`. A [Pipfile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile) contains package information that represents a python environment. Open your terminal and make sure you are still in the `your-folder` directory; then, run `pipenv shell`. You have now activated your python environment, the environment that contains the `arcgis` package! You can run `jupyter notebook` or `python` in this environment to start using the API.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Pipenv differs from conda and other environment managers in that environments are specific to the folder that contains the Pipfile. In this way, pipenv's use of `Pipfile` is similar to how `npm` uses `package.json`. To learn more about installing and using pipenv, click [here](https://docs.pipenv.org/) or [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#installing-packages-for-your-project).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Tip__: You can run any command in an environment without activating it by running `pipenv run {insert_command_here}` in a directory with a valid Pipfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is the predecessor of pipenv, and can also be used to install packages from PyPI (but you must manage environments with seperate tools like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)). To install the API with pip, open a terminal and enter the following command:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install arcgis\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disclaimer\n",
    "You should avoid mixing conda with pipenv/pip: they are completely seperate package managers. It is recommended that you use conda to install the API if you are a beginner user. Read more about the differences [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20994716/what-is-the-difference-between-pip-and-conda) and [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Note__: when installing the ArcGIS API for Python with pipenv/pip, some dependencies may require Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0. If you see any errors related to this, either install the Microsoft Visual C++ tools or install the API without dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install with minimum dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `conda install -c esri arcgis` and `pip install arcgis` will install all of the dependencies outlined in the [system requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/system-requirements/) section. However, the API can function in a 'stripped down' state with only a few dependencies. This means you can manually manage the dependencies on your system if you don't want to use every feature of the API. As of v1.8.0 of the Python API, the minimum dependencies needed are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `six`\n",
    " - `requests`\n",
    "    - This library has its own dependencies that must be included\n",
    " - `requests_toolbelt`\n",
    " - `requests_ntlm`\n",
    "    - This library has its own dependencies that must be included\n",
    " - `ntlm_auth`\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the API with no dependencies, simply add the `--no-deps` flag to any install command, i.e. `conda install -c esri arcgis --no-deps` or `pip install arcgis --no-deps`. You can then manually choose which dependencies to add to your Python environment."
