    "## Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Kalman filtering uses a series of measurements observed over time and produces estimates of unknown variables by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our state contains 8 variables; `(u,v,a,h,u’,v’,a’,h’)` where `(u,v)` are centres of the bounding boxes, a is the aspect ratio and h, the height of the image. The other variables are the respective velocities of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Kalman Filter is used on every bounding box, so it comes after a box has been matched with a tracker. When the association is made, predict and update functions are called. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction step is matrix multiplication that will tell us the position of our bounding box at time t based on its position at time t-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update\n",
    "\n",
    "Update phase is a correction step. It includes the new measurement from the Object Detection model and helps improve our filter.\n"
