 A concerned Spooner St. resident called police after seeing a man rummaging around inside her neighbor's parked car early this morning. A second person was near it, acting as an apparent lookout. Officers - utilizing good descriptions from the witness - located the two men not far from Spooner St. The one described as being inside the car had a pocket full of change. He was arrested for unlawful trespass to a vehicle. There was not probable cause to arrest the second man. The victim, who had left his car unlocked, said he was missing a few things, including loose change. Released 03/19/2018 at 2:38 PM by PIO Joel Despain
