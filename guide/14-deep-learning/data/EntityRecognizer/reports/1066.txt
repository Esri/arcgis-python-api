A group of people had met in the 900 block of Vernon and were holding a vigil in memory of the victim of the shooting in this area the night prior.  As this group was at this location, a vehicle approached and several shots were fired.  Responding officers were able to locate shell casings in the street very close to where the group had congregated.  Officers also located a vehicle and a nearby residence with damage that appeared to be consistent with being struck by a bullet, but it is unknown at this time if this damage was a result of this incident.  At this time, there have been no reported injuries related to this incident.
