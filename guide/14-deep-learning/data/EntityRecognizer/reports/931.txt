On 11/24/17, at approximately 6:25 pm, a couple was driving down the street when they observed what they believed to be a robbery in progress. The couple went and turned around, so that they could get a second look. Upon returning to the original location, they observed the two people still engaged with one another. The couple reported that it appeared one subject was in a surrender position with the second subject holding onto him. The caller stopped and asked the two if they were alright. The suspect told the caller that they were fine, but the victim was able to say that he was not. One of the occupants of the vehicle told the two that they were calling police. At that point the suspect, who had been rifling through the victim's belongings, picked up the victim's backpack and fled the area. The caller was able to watch the suspect and directed officers in. Officers were able to contact the suspect and locate the backpack, with the assistance of the caller. The suspect, Chattman Jordan, was taken into custody and charged with strong armed robbery. He was booked into the Dane County Jail. No one was physcially injured during the robbery.   Released 11/25/2017 at 7:45 PM by Lt. Kelly Donahue
