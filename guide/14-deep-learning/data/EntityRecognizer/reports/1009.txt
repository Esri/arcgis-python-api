 An eyewitness could not believe anyone could have survived the crash after a car slammed into a large utility pole and rolled at least four times along a ditch near the busy West Beltline Highway last night. In fact, a responding officer said the car was so badly damaged, she could not determine its make or model by looking at the wreck. The witness told police the driver tried to take a curve on Applegate Rd. while going around 75 mph. It is a 30 mph zone. The motorist was able to crawl out of the smashed car. He sustained a head cut that required stitches, but was not seriously hurt. He was cited for drunken driving. Released 05/09/2018 at 10:08 AM by PIO Joel Despain
