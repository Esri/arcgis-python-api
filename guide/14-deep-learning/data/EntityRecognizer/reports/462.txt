 The MPD responded to a Northport Dr. apartment early this morning for a report of a baby having a seizure. Detectives from the Special Victims Unit quickly became involved as it became apparent the seven-month-old boy had suffered life-threatening injuries. The infant's father has just been arrested and tentatively charged with first degree reckless injury. SVU detectives are continuing to investigate. Released 04/04/2018 at 10:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
