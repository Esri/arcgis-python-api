 A driver for a food delivery service had pulled over on Superior St. Saturday afternoon to look at his phone as he was needing to check directions so he could get several bags from Crostini Sandwiches, 231 North St., to the right address. As he was doing this his passenger door swung open. A robber said, "Look I am going to need all this." The suspect grabbed the keys from the ignition and tried to take the victim's cell phone. The victim was able to maintain possession of it. The suspect then took the bags of sandwiches and fled to a nearby car containing two other teens. Shaken, but observant the victim called a description of the getaway car and its plate number. A MPD officer spotted the car and pulled it over near E. Johnson St. and N. Paterson St. The stolen food was inside and the three occupants were arrested for being party to a crime of robbery. Released 11/06/2017 at 10:00 AM by PIO Joel Despain
