 A 55-year-old Madison man told police he reached into his pocket for some gas money and ended up being robbed – at gunpoint - of all his cash.  He said he was walking near W. Washington Ave. early Sunday morning when he heard a car horn. He looked to see two acquaintances inside a car. It was being driven by a man the victim does not know. The passengers offered him a lift, if he was willing to pay for some fuel. The group ended up at Brittingham Park where the victim took out his money, just as the driver took out his gun. Following the robbery, the victim was kicked out of the car and he called for police. The suspects are at large.  Released 03/13/2017 at 10:33 AM by PIO Joel Despain
