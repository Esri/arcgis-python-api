Three Milwaukee women decided to drive to Madison to so some holiday "shopping" Thursday afternoon. While inside West Towne's Boston Store, private security saw the trio running around grabbing armfuls of clothing before heading for the exits, without paying. The security officer was able to execute a takedown tackle on one suspect, while the other two dumped stolen merchandise they were carrying in the parking lot as they succeeded in getting away. The total retail value of the recovered clothing is over $3,000.  Released 12/18/2015 at 10:47 AM by PIO Joel Despain
