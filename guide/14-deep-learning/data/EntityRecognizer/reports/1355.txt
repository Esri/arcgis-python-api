 A Madison Police officer suffered non life-threatening injuries after a drunken driver ran a red light and drove his car into her squad early Sunday morning. The officer was inbound on W. Johnson St. and crossing N. Bassett St. when the crash occurred. She radioed for help, and responding officers found the suspect still inside his car which was now up on a sidewalk. When asked for his driver's license, he handed over a credit card. The 27-year-old Stoughton man, who was agitated and aggressive, was arrested on tentative charges listed above. The officer was treated and released for several injuries including a concussion. She continues to recover at home. Released 04/11/2016 at 10:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
