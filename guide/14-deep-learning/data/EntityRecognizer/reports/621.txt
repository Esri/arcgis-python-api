When Central District officers caught up with the suspect on W. Lakelawn Place yesterday afternoon they asked why he had yellowish and white colored powder all over his clothing. "I was baking a cake," he told them, but that is not what several frightened witnesses saw him doing. They said the 22-year-old was armed with a fire extinguisher, and had been yelling and chasing people around while spraying the fire retardant. Two women, both age 19, said they first encountered the suspect near State Street and that he chased them to their West Lakelawn Place apartment building. Disturbed and worried, they were able to get safely inside. A third woman, age 20, said the suspect also aggressed upon her, and she was also able to get behind the secure door of her residence. She then watched as he sprayed a man who was across the street. As the suspect moved on, she went to check on the victim. He was dumbfounded: "What just happened to me?" he said. The suspect, who had been drinking, was taken into custody on two counts of disorderly conduct. An arresting officers indicated he would request - as a condition of bail - that the DA prohibit the man from possessing a fire extinguisher "other than for the express purpose of putting out an actual fire."  Released 10/26/2018 at 11:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
