Two men and a teenager were arrested Saturday afternoon after West District officers discovered two handguns inside a car in which they were traveling. The car was pulled over on a routine traffic stop near the intersection of Raymond Rd. and South Whitney Way. A police dog "hit" on it for the possible presence of contraband and it was searched revealing the weapons. Released 05/22/2017 at 1:32 PM by PIO Joel Despain
