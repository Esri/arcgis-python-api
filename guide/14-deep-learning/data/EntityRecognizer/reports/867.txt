 A Worthington Ave. apartment building, with children inside, was hit by two bullets. An unoccupied parked car was also struck this morning as a gunman - who was on foot - fired numerous rounds. Witnesses told officers there were two loose dogs in the area and they believe the man could have been firing at the animals. He jumped into a tan colored car or small SUV and fled the area. There have been no reports of injuries to humans or to the dogs. Officers recovered seven to eight shell casings. Released 06/20/2017 at 11:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
