 Two children, ages 9 and 11, were playing outside Sunday night near Todd Dr. and Ardsley Circle when they reported seeing two "scary" men. The girls said both had knives, with one dressed as a clown and the other wearing a Halloween type mask. The victims said the men spoke to them as they ran up the street. The frightened children immediately reported the encounter to trusted adults and police were called. There were no other reports regarding men similarly attired and officers are working to corroborate the report.    Released 07/03/2017 at 10:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
