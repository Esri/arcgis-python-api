 The MPD arrested two men last night following an attempted burglary where seven rolls of copper wire were removed from a warehouse at Alter Metal Recycling, 4400 Sycamore Ave. The copper was found 200 yards from where it had been stored, near a fence, where it appeared someone was going to load it into a vehicle. Responding officers found two men walking nearby, on some railroad tracks. The investigation connected them to the crime scene and they were arrested for attempted burglary. A company manager arrived and identified one suspect as a former employee who was fired several weeks ago. He valued the copper at $150.    Released 03/03/2016 at 9:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
