Officers responded to John Nolen Dr. yesterday afternoon after a driver was found asleep behind the wheel. The car she was driving was in a traffic lane near Monona Terrace. It was running, and she had her foot on the brake. There were two infants in the backseat, and officers and firefighters were repeatedly rapping on windows trying to awaken the motorist. When that failed, a firefighter broke out the front passenger window, allowing a MPD officer to access the backseat and rescue the children. They ended up in the Chief's Conference Room with officers changing diapers and caring for the babies. "Both children, after being in our presence, and being in our custody for some time were both calm and playful and seemed to be in good spirits," wrote one officer in her report on the case. The driver was arrested on two counts of second degree recklessly endangering safety, operating while revoked, bail jumping, and fourth offense operating while under the influence with passengers under 16-years of age.  Released 05/09/2019 at 9:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
