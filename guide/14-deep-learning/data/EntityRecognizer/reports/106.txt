Madison Police Officers responded to the 3500 block of Ridgeway Avenue on Christmas Eve reference a residential burglary. Just after 7pm, a family came home, and found that someone had entered their residence; taking all of their Christmas presents. The suspect(s) turned over furniture, went through dresser drawers, and took other items of value from the dwelling. As one might imagine, the family (which also included a 10-year-old male & 13-year-old female) were devastated by this event, but police sought to determine how this could have occurred. There seemed to be no forced entry into doors or windows, and there was no evidence left behind by the suspect(s) to afford police some investigative starting point.  With the lack of witness accounts, the public is asked to contact police with any information that might help in this investigation; specifically any activities around the residence 24-hours leading up to this burglary being reported to police. This family continues to try to pull their lives back together during this holiday season, and the Madison Police Department reminds the public to be diligent about watching any suspicious activity around your neighbor's residences. Any questionable individuals or activity should be reported to the police immediately. PO Howard Payne  Released 12/26/2015 at 9:43 AM by P.O. Howard Payne
