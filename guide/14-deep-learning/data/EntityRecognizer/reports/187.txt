Anyone who rides a bike on State Street if fully aware of the potential obstacles: delivery trucks, Madison Metro buses, skateboarders, jaywalkers, protesters, taxicabs, students, etc. Well, on some nights peddlers should also be aware that the MPD has horses on State St. And, if you encounter a member of the mounted patrol, it would be a best practice to take a wide berth. Such was not the case this past Saturday when Ahab, Bubba, Luna and Torres were out with their human MPD partners, keeping the peace. Not only did a 23-year-old downtown bicyclist not provide Ahab adequate horse space, he also tried to pass Ahab's location "hands free" when both should have been firmly planted on his bike's handlebars. The young man – although operating without a light – did have a helmet on, which was good thing when he and Ahab's left hip collided. The bicyclist fell to the pavement and was not injured. Ahab also seemed no worse for the impact following what is believed to be State Street's first bicycle versus horse accident.    Released 09/19/2016 at 3:44 PM by PIO Joel Despain
