 The MPD is working with Dane County Sheriff's investigators to determine if there are any connections between an armed robbery that took place in the Town of Westport Wednesday night and a similar hold up that happened in Madison on March 25th. Both cases involve two armed and masked men showing at poker games. In the Madison case, several men were robbed of money, phones and jewelry while they were playing inside an International Lane office building.    Released 06/03/2016 at 12:37 PM by PIO Joel Despain
