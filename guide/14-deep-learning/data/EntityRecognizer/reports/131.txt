A witness said a bicyclist "flew off her bike head over heels" after being struck by a car while trying to peddle across W. Washington Ave. Wednesday afternoon. The cyclist was on the Southwest Commuter Path and in a crosswalk at the time of the collision. Other cars had stopped as she headed westbound, but one driver did not see her, and he did not stop. The 21-year-old motorist was cited for failure to yield. The bicyclist was transported to a hospital with a leg injury. She was wearing a helmet. Released 06/16/2016 at 11:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
