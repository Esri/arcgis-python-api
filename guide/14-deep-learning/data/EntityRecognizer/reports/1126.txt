The MPD took a robbery suspect into custody on State St. early Sunday morning. Officers were called to the 600 block after a 22-year-old Cottage Grove man was threatened with violence and sexual assault. The victim was seated on a bench when the suspect approached and demanded money. He told the robber he had no cash, and the ordered him to turn over his debit card. The frightened man produced it and fled to a nearby convenience store where he asked a clerk to call 911. Police were on scene quickly, and the suspect was still in the area. He denied robbing the victim. The victim's debit card was found in the suspect's pocket. Released 10/24/2016 at 9:59 AM by PIO Joel Despain
