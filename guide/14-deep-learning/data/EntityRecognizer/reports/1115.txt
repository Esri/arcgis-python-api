A Madison man was arrested Thursday, January 25th, 2018, on tentative child pornography charges, as part of an ongoing investigation by the Madison Police Department's Special Victims Unit, and with assistance from the Wisconsin Department of Justice Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.  Patrick J. Manning, 37, is tentatively charged with 20 counts of possession of child pornography. The Special Victim's Unit received an escalated tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, requiring an aggressive response due to Manning's employment at the American Family Children's Hospital, and his potential access to children.  Throughout the development of investigative leads and evidence, there has not been any information obtained that led anyone to believe that any person, connected to the American Family Children's Hospital, was in any way impacted by Manning; based on the nature of listed charges.  A search warrant was executed by the SWAT team at Manning's residence in the 1300 block of Drake Street on January 16th, 2018.  Subsequent investigation led to the tentative charges.     Early on in the investigation, American Family Children's Hospital administration was notified of the exigent circumstances and cooperated fully with the Special Victim's Unit.  PO Howard Payne  Released 01/25/2018 at 1:54 PM by P.O.
