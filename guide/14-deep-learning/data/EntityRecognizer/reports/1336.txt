 No one was hurt after a 29-year-old man fired a rifle inside an Atticus Way apartment last evening. The round went through a door and lodged in a car parked outside. Multiple officers were dispatched, and they set up a perimeter as many concerned residents had heard the loud report. Police made their way into the suspect's apartment and took him into custody without incident. A 31-year-old victim told police he is an acquaintance of the suspect, and that he and a third man were inside the suspect's apartment when an argument broke out. He says the suspect armed himself with the weapon and pointed it at him. At that point, he says he and the third man feared for their safety and ran outside. A short time later they heard the gunshot. The suspect says it was an accidental discharge and that he was cleaning the rifle. He was arrested on tentative charges listed above.   Released 05/02/2018 at 11:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
