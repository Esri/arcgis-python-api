The MPD was called to a street fight Tuesday afternoon. In the end, three 14-year-old girls were arrested. A mother of one suspect was among the battered. The violence was recorded by at least one onlooker, and several witnesses can be heard encouraging the combatants. An officer was able to view the brawl on a Facebook page, and that helped identify who should be arrested. The 55-second video clip shows the three teens punching and kicking each other, with two battering also battering the mother. One witness said the violence had something to do with one of the girl's posting something on social media. Released 02/24/2016 at 1:26 PM by PIO Joel Despain
