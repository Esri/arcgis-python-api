On June 11, 2019 at approximately 11:09pm, Madison Police officers were dispatched to 122 E. Gilman Street (Lakeshore Apartments) regarding an Armed Robbery/Substantial Battery. The victim was outside working on his car when he was approached by the suspect who brandished a firearm, then "pistol whipped" the victim, and took personal property from him before fleeing the area on foot. Despite sustaining serious injuries, the victim gave chase but lost the suspect as he was running southbound on N. Butler Street. It is believed that the suspect got into a vehicle (described as a late 1990's Honda Accord with defective muffler) somewhere on N. Butler Street between E. Gilman and E. Gorham Street and left the area prior to police arrival. The suspect has not been apprehended. The Madison Police Department will continue to investigate this incident but if anyone has any information regarding it, please contact the Madison Police or Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.
