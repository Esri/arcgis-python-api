 A Madison man says he was punched and kicked while being mugged by four men early this morning. The 36-year-old victim said he was walking on Haywood Dr., near S. Park St., when a white sedan stopped near his location. The driver stayed inside while four passengers got out. He said one was armed with a handgun and all attacked him. They made off with his wallet and wristwatch. The man went to a nearby hospital for treatment of minor head and torso injuries. Released 09/08/2016 at 3:31 PM by PIO Joel Despain
