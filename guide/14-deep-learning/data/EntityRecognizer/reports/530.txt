 The MPD was called to a hospital early Sunday morning after a 23-year-old Madison man showed up with a stab wound to the back of his neck. The victim claimed he was injured during a fight on State St. He said he and another man grappled and threw punches, but he did not immediately realize he had been stabbed. He did not recall seeing any weapons. The neck wound required 10 stitches to close, and the treating physician said the victim was lucky as the weapon had come very close to hitting his spinal cord.
