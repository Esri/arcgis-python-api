 The MPD has taken two complaints from area bar owners today after scam artists attempted to extort money by claiming to be with Madison Gas and Electric. A person identifying himself as "Charlie Baker" claimed crews would be dispatched, to shut down power, with all due haste if unpaid bills were not paid immediately. The owner of the Village Bar, 3801 Mineral Point Rd. and the owner of Wilson's Bar, 2144 Atwood Ave., received calls and the investigating officer believes other taverns will likely be targeted as this reoccurring scam surfaces again. Neither business contacted today fell for the fraud. Released 05/05/2016 at 2:52 PM by PIO Joel Despain
