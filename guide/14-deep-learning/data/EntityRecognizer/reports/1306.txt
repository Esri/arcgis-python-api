 On Wednesday evening, December 26, 2018 at 7:38 pm, Madison Police Officers were sent to investigate a motor vehicle/pedestrian crash on South Gammon Road near Gammon Lane. Initial reports indicated a sixteen year old driver was southbound on Gammon Road preparing to turn right onto New Washburn Way when he struck a man running across Gammon Road.  The man suffered non-life threatening injuries and was transported to a local hospital. It is believed the man was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision. Another driver, northbound on Gammon Road also saw the pedestrian and reported that the man had not been looking as he "skip-walked" across the four lanes of Gammon Road. That driver had to brake suddenly to avoid striking the man. The young driver was cited and released for failure to have a valid driver's license.  The pedestrian is required to report to the Dane County Jail for violating rules of probation which prohibit him from possessing or consuming alcohol.
