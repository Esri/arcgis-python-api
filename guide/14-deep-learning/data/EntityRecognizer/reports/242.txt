 An 18-year-old Madison man has reported an armed robbery to police where he and two friends were mugged while walking in the 700 block of Riverside Drive early Tuesday morning. The MPD was not immediately contacted. The victims say two men and a woman got out of a cream colored sedan after spotting them, circling the block, and coming back again. One teen was placed in a chokehold and had his longboard stolen. A second victim had a knife pulled on him while an assailant tried to take his phone. The victim was able to maintain possession. One teen yelled for help, and the trio got back in the car and drove off. He said it appeared the robbers were "cruising for targets." Released 06/23/2016 at 12:59 PM by PIO Joel Despain
