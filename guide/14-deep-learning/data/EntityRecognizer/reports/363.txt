 A McDonald's cashier was left badly shaken and crying following a strong-armed robbery at the restaurant chain's Dryden Dr. location last evening. A diner told responding officers it was "some scrawny-looking white dude" who pulled off the crime. The victim said the man ordered some cookies, and then stepped behind the counter - where employees stand – where he told her to open the register. He did so while passing a note indicating this was a robbery. He fled with cash from the till. Released 02/16/2017 at 10:13 AM by PIO Joel Despain
