 A dispute over who had the right-of-way to exit a downtown parking ramp escalated into road rage early Saturday morning as two feuding drivers headed out University Ave. near N. Lake St. One, a 21-year-old Fond du Lac man, said there was an exchange of words which led him to give a one-finger salute. He said the other man responded by saying he would kill the Fond du Lac motorist. After making the statement, the other man pointed a handgun at the victim. The victim took some evasive maneuvers, lost the other driver, and called police. Released 04/30/2018 at 10:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
