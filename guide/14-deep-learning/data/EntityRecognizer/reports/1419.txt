  A 21-year-old driver, a woman from Madison, was not seriously injured when her car was struck by a train Monday afternoon. The collision took place on tracks that cross N. Whitney Way, near the intersection with Old Middleton Rd. The driver was heading north. She and a couple of other motorists, who were just in front of her, had stopped for a red light. At this intersection drivers are to stay behind a white line, just prior to the tracks, when the lights are red. Instead, the drivers pulled up just behind the traffic signal. At that moment, a train approached, and a rail gate came down. The 21-year-old could not pull forward because of cars stopped ahead of her, and the back of her Saturn was hanging over the tracks. The train's conductor was unable to stop and estimates hitting the car while going about 25 mph. The train dragged the car several feet. It sustained significant rear-end damage. The 21-year-old driver was cited for a red signal violation.  Released 12/13/2016 at 3:15 PM by PIO Joel Despain
