A Madison officer observed a vehicle driving poorly in the area of McKenna Blvd near Hammersley Road.  A records check of the vehicle showed it was stolen December 23rd from the Southside of Madison. When officers initiated a traffic stop the driver slowed and ran from the vehicle.  This vehicle crashed into a tree as it came to a stop.   Multiple officers set up a perimeter and the 15 year old driver was arrested after a short foot chase.  The Town of Madison Canine also assisted in this incident. The juvenile was brought to the Dane County Juvenile Reception Center where he was charged with resisting arrest and operating a motor vehicle without owners consent.   Released 12/27/2015 at 3:44 AM by Sgt.
