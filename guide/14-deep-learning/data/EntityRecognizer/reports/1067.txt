 A Madison man was arrested Saturday inside East Towne Mall after a concerned citizen saw him display a handgun. Multiple officers responded and contacted the suspect. He had a real looking BB gun in a backpack. The mall was crowded and the weapons call created a disturbance as families saw officers remove the facsimile firearm while the suspect yelled and resisted police. The initial caller told the MPD he felt compelled to call 911 because of recent gun violence in the community. Released 05/09/2016 at 9:52 AM by PIO Joel Despain
