One resident, a 55-year-old man, told responding officers, "I hit the deck because I thought they were shooting my house. Another, living on the block, said his dog went "ballistic," while other neighbors - concerned for their safety - just called 911 as bullets flew in the 1800 block of Windom Way last night. Witnesses said there were cars stopped in the street prior to the gunfire, with people milling about. They said these are individuals who do not live in the neighborhood, and there has been an ongoing concern about possible drug trafficking. The homeowners were told this problem will be on the North District's Community Police Team's radar. Citizens and officers recovered five shell casings from the street following the gun violence.  Released 10/06/2016 at 8:37 AM by PIO Joel Despain
