 A 40-year-old Madison man was arrested for his fifth offense of operating while intoxicated after an officer found him in the driver's seat of a car that had stopped in traffic Sunday night at the intersection of Lansing St. and Dawes St. The car's headlights were off and the driver was slumped over the wheel. He later admitted that he had been drinking. Released 01/09/2017 at 10:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
