 A Madison woman selling a used riding lawn mower on Craigslist for $200 was sent a check for $1,650 after an out-of-town "buyer" corresponded, letting the 55-year-old know she and her husband would like to buy the mower sight unseen. The would-be victim was told to deposit the check and wire funds - above and beyond the purchase price - to the person who would be paid to move the mower. This arrangement did not pass the seller's smell test and she had her bank take a good hard look at the buyer's check. It was bogus. The seller sent a text back to the scam artist, "thanks for the fake check. Please don't contact me again. You are not very nice people to do this to the poor and disabled." The woman let police know she is disabled as a result of an accident. Released 06/23/2017 at 10:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
