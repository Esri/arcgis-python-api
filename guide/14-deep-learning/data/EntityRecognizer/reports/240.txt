 A 14-year-old girl ran to the home of a trusted adult after a stranger asked her to get into a car Monday afternoon. The child was on Jacobs Way, near Loreen Dr., on her way home from school, when the driver stopped near her location. She said he opened the door and asked her to enter. That is when she ran. She described the car as white, older, but in good condition. Released 03/21/2017 at 9:28 AM by PIO Joel Despain
