 A Sunday night dog walk turned into a mugging in the 1700 block of Fordem Ave. A 22-year-old woman had taken her pets outside around 9:00 p.m. when she was approached from behind. A stranger spun her around, punched her in the face several times, and pushed her to the ground. He demanded her wallet and cell phone. She had neither with her and that made the would-be robber angry. He kicked her in the ribs a couple of times before running off. The victim, who suffered facial injuries, was unable to get a good look at the man. Released 11/21/2016 at 10:10 AM by PIO Joel Despain
