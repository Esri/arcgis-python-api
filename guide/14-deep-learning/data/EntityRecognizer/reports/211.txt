A Berkshire Rd. resident started her Range Rover this morning and left it unattended outside of her home for a few minutes while it warmed up. That was enough time for two teens to jump in the luxury SUV and take off. A MPD officer spotted the Range Rover shortly after 8:00 a.m. and followed it as it turned into the McDonald's parking lot on Odana Rd. The suspects jumped out, but did not put the Range Rover in park. It rolled into another parked car, causing an accident. The MPD officer chased after the driver who eventually ran into Memorial High School where he was arrested and taken to the Juvenile Reception Center.   Released 01/22/2019 at 12:17 PM by PIO Joel Despain
