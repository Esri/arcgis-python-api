 A Madison woman told police she was able to escape from an attempted carjacking by getting out of her vehicle and running. She said she was parked in the 1100 block of Morraine View Dr. on March 3rd, waiting to pick up her daughter up at a bus stop. Two men got into her unlocked vehicle. One pulled out a knife and ordered her to drive. That's when she jumped out. Moments later, she said the men also got out and fled. Released 03/18/2016 at 10:43 AM by PIO Joel Despain
