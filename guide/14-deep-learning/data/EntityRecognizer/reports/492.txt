 Central District detectives are investigating a targeted armed robbery from early this morning. Two men were robbed of their wallets and cell phones after getting into a SUV with three men. The robbers and victims had been socializing together at a downtown bar. One victim - the 19-year-old listed above - said a gun was pointed at them after they got inside the SUV. He was battered, both inside the vehicle, and once he got out in a Langdon Street parking lot. Once outside of the SUV, the robbers ordered the teen to disrobe. He then ran naked to a nearby address in the 200 block of W. Lakelawn Place where residents called for police. The second victim was not battered, but was taken to detox due to his level of intoxication. Released 11/14/2018 at 10:19 AM by PIO Joel Despain
