A 23-year-old man reported someone got into his car and stole his 9mm handgun. He came to the MPD's North District station yesterday to report the crime telling police the weapon had been inside his car. It was parked outside his East Bluff residence, and he thought it had been locked. He said he likes to leave the firearm in the car because he has little kids at home.
