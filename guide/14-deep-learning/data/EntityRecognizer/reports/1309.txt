A witness called the 911 Center regarding a green Chevy Equinox parked in a parking lot on the 2500 Bl University Ave. which had a man passed out in it.  Further information was then provided that the man had woken up and started driving, but was having trouble getting out of the parking lot.  A MPD officer subsequently observed this vehicle traveling eastbound on University Ave..  This vehicle was eventually stopped on W Johnson St near N Carroll St..  An investigation led to the arrest of Eugene Trimble for OMVWI, for which he has four prior convictions.  He is also out on bail on a OMVWI charge from a previous incident and has a revoked driving status.  After the investigation was completed he was booked into the Dane County Public Safety Building.   Released 12/24/2018 at 11:01 AM by Lt.
