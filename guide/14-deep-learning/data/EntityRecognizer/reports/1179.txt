The Madison Police Department Burglary Crime Unit is asking the public's help in identifying two downtown burglars.On June 7, 2018 at about 1:40 am, two white men in their early twenties entered into the Hub Apartments in the 400 block of North Frances Street. The pair targeted a dozen eggs and whey protein nutrition supplement.  Although the loss in dollars from theft was not significant, the two then went on to cause several hundred dollars damage to the carpeting. They also attempted to steal a bicycle from the same property.City controlled and privately held surveillance cameras allowed detectives to follow the movements of the pair as they moved about the downtown area. The two men would be wise to turn themselves in to Madison Police.  With the help of the public in identifying the burglars, their apprehension seems inevitable.Anyone with information may call 255-2345 or Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.   Released 06/26/2018 at 1:23 PM by P.O.
