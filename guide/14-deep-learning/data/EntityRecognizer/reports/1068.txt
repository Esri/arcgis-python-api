 On 6/10/16 at 11:54 a.m. several Madison Police Officers responded to a report of a child left inside a car.  Due to the heat of the day and length of time inside the car (close to 4 hours) Madison Fire also responded with their ambulance.  Officers learned an 11-month old had been inside this car all morning.  Preliminary indications are the child will survive and our community dodged a tragedy.  Both family and Officers were elated at the end of the hospital visit to see the child smiling and giggling.  With summer upon us and the heat moving in, this serves a good reminder for car safety.  For those who share joint responsibilities in taking children to daycare, set up a system of checks and balances.  Be sure to have your daycare contact several sources if your child does not arrive on a scheduled day.  Research finds it does not take long for a car to heat up with the windows closed.  For instance, when the outside temperature is 80 degrees, the average car will be 109 degrees in 20 minutes, 114 degrees in 30 minutes and 121 degrees in 50 minutes.  When the air temperature outside is 90 degrees the car inside will be 109 degrees after 10 minutes, 124 degrees after 30 minutes and 133 degrees after 1 hour.   Released 06/10/2016 at 1:03 PM by Lt.
