 A 20-year-old Madison woman was arrested for first degree reckless endangerment after she sped down Northport Dr. with another young woman clinging to the hood of her car. The suspect also had two children with her. After officers pulled her over, they were able to determine she had been involved in a disturbance in the parking lot of a nearby apartment complex. The suspect says she was punched in the face by a woman with whom she has an ongoing dispute. She responded by spraying mace, some of which may have hit unintended targets, including a child. The woman found clinging to the hood is that child's mother. She jumped on the car, evidently trying to get the suspect to stop. She was not injured.
