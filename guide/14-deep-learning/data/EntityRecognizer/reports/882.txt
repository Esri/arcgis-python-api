The victims believe a masked burglar was able to access their Milky Way home early this morning by using a garage door opener that was inside an unlocked car parked in the driveway. The burglar, who was tall and thin and wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, was spotted by a family member who saw him through a cracked bedroom door. He fled after taking keys to a 2016 Toyota RAV4. The SUV was stolen during the break-in. Released 06/18/2019 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
