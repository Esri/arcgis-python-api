Shortly after 5:24am on 3/6/2016, officers were dispatched to a significant accident at the intersection of US 12-18 (eb) & Millpond Road.  Officers arrived on scene and found a 2008 Chevrolet suv rolled on its side from the impact by a 1999 green Ford Mustang.  Hwy 12-18 (eb) was shut down for a short period of time until officers could stabalize the scene.  From preliminary reports, obtained from parties on scene, officers determined that the suv pulled out from Millpond Road to access wb US Hwy 12-18, when the convergence accident occurred, with the green Mustang traveling east bound at highway speed.  Madison Fire Department and Monona Paramedics responded to deal with approximately five injured individuals (ranging in age from 44yrs – 60yrs) who were transported to nearby hospitals for what are currently thought to be non life threatening injuries.  The top of the suv had to be cut off to remove the injured occupants.  While all parties of the suv were accounted for during the chaotic scene, the occupant(s) of the Ford Mustang fled the vehicle, and are still be sought by police for hit & run charges.  Alcohol is thought to potentially be a factor in this accident, but anyone with information is urged to contact police.    PO Howard Payne  Released 03/06/2016 at 10:09 AM by P.O.
