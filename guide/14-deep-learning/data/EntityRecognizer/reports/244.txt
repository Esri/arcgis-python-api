A dispute between male coworkers led to a stabbing at the West Towne Mall Food Court this afternoon. The suspect, a 60-year-old man, and the victim, a 34-year-old man, both are employed by West Towne Mall. The victim suffered a superficial stab wound to the back, and a scratch to the neck. Because the call came in regarding a man with a knife inside the mall, there was a full active threat response by law enforcement with several agencies responding. The MPD took the suspect into custody. He is currently being questioned by investigators.   Released 03/18/2019 at 3:35 PM by PIO Joel Despain
