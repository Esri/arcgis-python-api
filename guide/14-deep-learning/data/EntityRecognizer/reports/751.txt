An E. Mifflin St. resident was able to snap a couple of photos of teens who had just taken delivered packages off of porches in her neighborhood last month. Based on one image, the MPD was able to identify a 17-year-old suspect. He was arrested this past Friday. He has also been a suspect in a couple of theft cases from earlier this year. Released 11/07/2016 at 10:19 AM by PIO Joel Despain
