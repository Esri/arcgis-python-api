 Members of the MPD's Central District Community Police Team were able to recover a very special bicycle for a 28-year-old downtown resident. Her grandmother had bought her the 2016 Specialized Dolce Sport just prior to passing away. It was locked inside the victim's W. Main St. underground parking garage. She discovered it missing in late December, and days later found someone trying to sell it on Craigslist. Posing as a would-be buyer, a member of the CPT contacted the seller indicating he was seeking a bike that would fit a woman that is 5'3". The seller, in a poorly worded text, assured that it would: "Yeah it would definitely fit her that is my girls height and its her bike she is trying to sell. She only go to ride it a hand full of times last summer its barely used. not really any wear and tear on it at all." The officer arranged to meet the seller at a Fish Hatchery Rd. gas station this past Saturday. The officer brought with him other members of his unit, and when the seller arrived he was arrested. His girlfriend, who came with him, was cited. Both provided different stories about how the bicycle ended up in their car. One said they bought it on Craigslist; the other said it was purchased at a party. Both said the acquisition happened some time ago, which would be impossible since the victim's two-wheeler was just recently stolen. The prized bike is now back where it belongs.
