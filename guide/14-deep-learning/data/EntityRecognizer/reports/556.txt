Officers arrested a 42-year-old man for using racial slurs and starting a fight on a Madison Metro bus Saturday afternoon. Scott A. Munch, no permanent address, repeatedly used the "n-word" while talking to a woman friend. There were two African American girls seated directly in front of them. After using the "n-word" several times, the suspect tapped one on the shoulder and said, "I'm not a racist, I'm not using the word like that." A 22-year-old passenger, who is white, was really bothered by what he was witnessing and hearing. He decided it was time to directly address the suspect: "That's not cool. It's derogatory and it is racist no matter how you say it. That shows your ignorance." Listening to all of these exchanges were several African American men who were near the front of the bus. One also confronted the suspect: "You're racist, and you won't say it (the slur) to my face though." The suspect swore and did call the African American man the "n-word." Witnesses said the two got very close at this point with the suspect throwing the first punch. Both began exchanging blows, and at one point, they landed on top of a 46-year-old woman who also took an inadvertent punch to the head. The African American man's friends pulled him out of the fight, and the group got off the bus. The suspect then turned his anger toward the 22-year-old man who had first spoken up against the racist language. The suspect told him he should mind his own business and then lunged at the witness. The suspect punched the man, and the victim feared there would be more violence, but the suspect's female friend was able to get him off the bus near East Washington Ave. and E. Johnson St. Police were now in the area. They located and arrested the suspect for battery to a public transit passenger, disorderly conduct and bail jumping.    Released 05/13/2019 at 11:04 AM by PIO Joel Despain
