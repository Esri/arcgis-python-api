 MPD officers were working a special grant, pulling over traffic violators on John Nolen Dr. Tuesday afternoon, when one stop turned into a drug investigation. The driver of a car was pulled over for doing 49 in a 35 mph zone. The investigating officer quickly realized a pungent smell emanating from the car's interior was that of marijuana. A vacuum sealed bag containing about a pound of high-grade pot was found in the trunk as were eight individually wrapped packages of dope. The trunk also housed a loaded handgun. The driver, who was very cooperative, had a large amount of cash, and told police he had just sold another car. He ended up with much more than a speeding ticket. A passenger, also a 24-year-old Madison man, was also arrested for possessing a much smaller amount of marijuana which was found in his pocket. Released 08/10/2016 at 10:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
