 A 21-year-old Madison man needed stitches to close a head wound following a battery that took place early this morning in the Vintage Bar parking lot, 674 S. Whitney Way. Witnesses told police the suspect pushed the victim down, punched him several times in the head, and delivered multiple kicks to his stomach. Earlier, the suspect had gotten into dispute inside the bar with the victim and the victim's friends. He was wearing a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, and claimed to play for the club. The victim and his friends were skeptical and an argument ensued. It resulted in the suspect placing one of the friends in a headlock and also pulling his hair. For that offense, he was arrested for battery. For the outside attack, he was arrested for substantial battery. Released 03/10/2017 at 9:39 AM by PIO Joel Despain
