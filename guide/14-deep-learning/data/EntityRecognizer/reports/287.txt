 The MPD arrested a burglary suspect yesterday after his former employer reported more than $6,000 in laundry money had been stolen since August from The Embassy apartments, 505 University Ave. The suspect was seen on surveillance video entering a dozen separate laundry rooms in the multi-story building on more than one occasion. A manager became suspicious, and started checking video images, after money flow from laundry machines began to drop off by $500 to $600 a month.   She suspects the former employee - the suspect - made a master key allowing for after hour access to the building.
