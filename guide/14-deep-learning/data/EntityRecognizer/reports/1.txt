The MPD was called to Pink at West Towne Mall Tuesday night after two brazen shoplifters walked out with more than $1,700 worth of merchandise after having been inside the store for less than a minute. A manager told police her corporate office believes the same men are responsible for thousands of dollars worth of thefts at Pink stores in both Wisconsin and Illinois. Anyone with information on their identities can call Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 08/18/2016 at 10:37 AM by PIO Joel Despain
