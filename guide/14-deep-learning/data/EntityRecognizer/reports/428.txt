 On 6/25/2016, shortly after 8:13pm, officers were sent to the 10 block of N. Second Street reference a man with a gun and a disturbance.  Officers received information from a 61-year-old female, who described a road rage scenario involving a silver sport utility vehicle and a yellow Kawasaki motorcycle.  The complainant saw a verbal dispute between the two vehicles, and then a firearm be pulled from a holster by a 41-year-old subject, later identified as Louis Zampos.  Zampos immediately left the scene, but after responding officers obtained a description of the distinctive motorcycle, it was located a short distance away on Winnebago Street.  The officer, who spotted the motorcycle, then witnessed a plume of smoke/debris, and to his surprise, determined that Zampos had crashed.  The officer also saw US Currency strewn across the roadway, and he rushed over to render aid, while Madison Fire Department was summoned for potential injuries.  Zampos did not have any life threatening concerns, but did relay to officers that an argument with the unidentified driver of the suv did occur.  Zampos denied having removed his firearm from his holster, but did indicate to the suv driver that he was armed with a .380 handgun.  This entire ordeal started over each driver thinking the other should have been operating in a different fashion.  PO Howard Payne Released 06/27/2016 at 1:04 PM by P.O.
