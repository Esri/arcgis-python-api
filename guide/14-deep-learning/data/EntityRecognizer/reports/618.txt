Central District officers have tried to educate him about the Median Safety Ordinance: talking with him, giving him an explanatory pamphlet. When that didn't work, they began citing a 73-year-old Madison man.That didn't work either, and now they have begun arresting the man as he continues to sit on a yard chair in the median near East Washington Ave. and N. Blair St.   He holds a sign indicating he is a disabled veteran whose house has burned down. He has told officers he is a retired federal employee, on a pension. He lives in a home near to where he panhandles. It has not been damaged by fire. Nearby residents and business owners have complained about the panhandler. He "has been seen urinating in the adjacent parking lot as well as leaving litter behind and has been continually causing traffic issues by walking out into the moving traffic to obtain money being given by citizens in vehicles," a downtown officer wrote in his report after arresting the man again Sunday afternoon. The man had no response when the officer asked why he continues to panhandle in a place where he has been told time and again to stop. He was issued the maximum fine amount for the ordinance violation: $439.    Released 01/14/2019 at 11:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
