In a bizarre situation, a Madison Police Officer responded to 23 West Towne Mall, reference a 23-year-old female employee of JCPenney having been battered in the store.  The officer immediately noted scratches to the victim's face, and that the identified suspect (Alanah Cusimano) had fled the scene.  Cusimano had previously been a roommate of the victim, but both parties ceased any communication with one another since the summer 2015; due to a disagreement that sundered their friendship.  When officers eventually contacted Cusimano, she stated that she had been taunted by the victim; which inevitably led to the attack in the store.  The victim reported being approached by Cusimano, pulled down to the ground by her hair, and repeatedly punched in the head; until employees could separate both females.  Some employees even gave chase as Cusimano fled the department store.  Officers checked the area, but were unable to locate Cusimano.  Officers were able to connect with Cusimano at a later time, and she did state that she had been legitimately shopping in the store when the chance encounter occurred. She was taken into custody on the listed charge. PO Howard Payne  Released 12/29/2015 at 2:09 PM by P.O. Howard Payne
