 Three roommates were robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot of their Pinewood Court apartment building early Sunday morning. The victims were returning home from the downtown when a masked gunman approached and ordered them to the ground. They quickly gave up their possessions and the robber got into the front seat of a white car. Its driver was also armed. He pointed a second weapon at the victims, ordering them to run as the gunmen drove off. Released 08/28/2017 at 11:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
