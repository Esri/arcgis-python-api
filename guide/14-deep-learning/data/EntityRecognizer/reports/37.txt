 A 45-year-old Madison woman was dragged out of her own van and repeatedly battered by three acquaintances (one man and two women) Wednesday afternoon. The daylight attack happened in a very public place, the intersection of E. Johnson St. and N. Dickinson St. The victim had agreed to transport the suspects when a disagreement, while in transit, turned violent. After being pulled from the van, the woman was punched and thrown to the ground. Several chunks of her hair were pulled out. When she got back on her feet, the suspects swung her around and her head smashed into the van's windshield causing it to crack. The suspects fled on foot as several concerned passersby called 911. They remain at large. The victim was taken by ambulance to a hospital for treatment of head injuries.
