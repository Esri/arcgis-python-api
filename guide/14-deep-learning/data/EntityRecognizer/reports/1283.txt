He'd driven his Cadillac all the way from Florida to become a HOG member (Harley Owners Group). But when the 67-year-old arrived in Madison Tuesday morning, at a Bradbury Rd. address, the people at the home had no clue what he was talking about. The duped man called the MPD and explained – that while in the Sunshine State - he had responded to a classified newspaper advertisement. A man named "Paul" claimed to be selling a Harley Davidson motorcycle. Through the course of several phone calls and text messages, the victim had his son wire $2,000 to the "seller." "Paul" was asking for another $5,000 deposit on the chopper, but the would-be bike owner was not willing to pony up until he saddled up on the Harley, which he was told was at the Bradbury Rd. house in Madison. A MPD officer confirmed the family living there was not selling a Harley, or anything else for that matter, and that the address was just randomly picked by criminals as part of a scam. The Floridian provided the officer with "Paul's" phone number. The officer called it, and a man with an accent answered. After questions were asked about a Harley transaction in Madison, the man hung up. Released 04/19/2017 at 11:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
