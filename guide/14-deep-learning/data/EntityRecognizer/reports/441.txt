St. Dennis Catholic Church and St. Dennis Catholic School were evacuated, and Dempsey Rd. was temporarily shut down this morning after a suspicious package was found near a St. Vincent de Paul drop box. The package was marked flammable. Someone could also hear a ticking sound. The sound ended not coming from the package marked flammable but from another donation. Neither turned out to be anything dangerous, and first responders cleared the scene.  Released 06/18/2019 at 11:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
