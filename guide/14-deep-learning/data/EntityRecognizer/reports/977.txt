A Madison man, out on parole for a previous heroin case, was arrested again Thursday on new tentative drug dealing charges. Rufus L. Reynolds, age 55, was taken into custody, without incident, following a traffic stop conducted by members of the Dane County Narcotics Task Force.  They recovered two baggies of heroin. The investigative team next searched the Moorland Rd. apartment where Reynolds has been staying. More heroin was found. Task Force members also confiscated money, cell phones and drug packaging.  Released 03/01/2019 at 11:18 AM by PIO Joel Despain
