"It's the scariest thing in my whole life," an extremely distraught college student told a responding police officer after the 23-year-old was nearly stabbed in the 700 block of State Street early this morning. The victim had just returned to Madison from his parents' home and was carrying some things to his dorm, including a large comforter. It likely saved him from serious injury. He said a mumbling stranger approached him and pulled out a knife. The suspect lunged at the victim, stabbing at him with the blade. The victim believes he would have been hit in the head or upper torso save for the fact he used the quilt to shield himself from the weapon. He dropped all of his school supplies and ran to a nearby convenience store to summon police. Utilizing his description, officers were able to locate the suspect at the other end of State St., near the Capitol Square. He was arrested on tentative charges listed above Released 09/11/2017 at 8:58 AM by PIO Joel Despain
