 A 76-year-old man suffered life-threatening injuries after being struck by a car while trying to cross E. Buckeye Rd. last evening. The man was dressed in dark clothing and not in a crosswalk. The car's driver, a 68-year-old Madison woman, estimated she was going about 15 to 20 mph - preparing to turn onto northbound S. Stoughton Rd. from westbound E. Buckeye Rd. - when the pedestrian suddenly appeared in front of her. She was unable to stop in time. Officers said the driver was very cooperative and did not appear to be impaired. The accident is under investigation by a MPD traffic specialist. Released 01/25/2017 at 10:19 AM by PIO Joel Despain
