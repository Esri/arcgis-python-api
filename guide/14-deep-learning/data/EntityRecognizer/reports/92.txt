 Presidential politics and pool did not mix well early Sunday morning as two men, shooting some stick, got into a heated exchange over the Republican Party's nominee. Friends pulled one of the men from Pooley's Sports Bar, 5441 High Crossing Blvd., after he lifted his Hawaiian shirt, exposing a handgun that was tucked in the waistband of his khaki shorts. Witnesses said the armed man had been loudly yelling Donald Trump's name as he voiced support for the candidate. A Madison man responded by also uttering Trump's name, only he used a word that rhymes with truck in front of it. That is when those at the pool tables got a look the gun. A bouncer intervened before things got physical, and informed the gunman that weapons were not allowed in the facility. The man pushed the bouncer and said, "I'm going to put one in you." That's when his friends strongly encouraged him to leave as police were being called. Released 08/08/2016 at 11:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
