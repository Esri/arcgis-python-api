A worker was inside of the stadium when he observed two juveniles inside the ballpark.  The worker approached the juveniles and informed them that they could not be there.  The male black juvenile responded by pulling a black handgun from his pants and displaying it.  The gun was not pointed at the worker.  The juveniles then fled the area on foot and they were not located.
