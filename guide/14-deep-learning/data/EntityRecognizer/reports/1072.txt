 A projectile struck and broke a Madison Metro bus window Saturday night as the driver was operated on S. Thompson Dr. It could not be determined if it was a sling shot round, a bullet, or something else the penetrated glass. Bus video shows a passenger removing something from the area where damage - a circular hole – occurred. It is believed this could have been the projectile. There were no injuries.
