 UPDATE from Chief Michael Koval: Madison Police Department was dispatched to Visions Nightclub (3554 E Washington Ave) in regards to a large fight in progress.  While en route, officers were notified that shots had been fired inside the establishment.  Upon arrival, a large crowd was found and there were five injured subjects.  Four of the victims were injured by gunfire and one individual was stabbed.  Of the individuals who were shot, one required surgery but is in stable condition.  The other gunshot victims did not sustain life-threatening injuries requiring a surgical response.  The victim who was stabbed was treated and medically cleared.  All of the victims were treated at local hospitals.  At the time this incident occurred, there were an estimated 40 to 50 people present as patrons in the bar.  The precipitating event for this large-scale fight may have been over a re-entry issue where someone was originally kicked out of the bar.  This entire incident is deemed to be confined to the immediate set of facts, and there is no ongoing danger to the public at this time.  Investigation continuing   Released 12/09/2018 at 4:25 AM by Lt.
