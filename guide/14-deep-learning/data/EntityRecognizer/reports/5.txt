A drug peddling investigation in the Northport Drive area resulted in the arrest of a 22-year-old resident Monday afternoon. He was taken into custody outside of his apartment on numerous tentative charges (see above) after running from members of MPD SWAT and the Dane County Narcotics Task Force. A search of his person and home turned up drugs, drug packaging, documents and cash. While police were chasing the primary suspect, another man may have thought he was being pursued, as officers saw him toss a handgun. It turned out to be a BB gun. When contacted, the 21-year-old had a switchblade in his waistband and was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and a parole hold. A third man, who came outside evidently to see what the commotion was about, was also arrested. The 21-year-old was wanted on parole and theft warrants. Prior to their arrival, officers were told he is a neighbor of the drug dealing suspect and should be arrested if spotted. Task Force leaders say all this happened very quickly with the three men taken into custody in about three minutes.  Released 08/22/2018 at 10:39 AM by PIO Joel Despain
