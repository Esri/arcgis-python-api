The MPD continues to urge everyone to lock their vehicles as a crime trend - going back several months - continued overnight. A Hiawatha Dr. home in the Nakoma Neighborhood was burglarized as a family slept. A criminal(s) got into an unlocked car, which was parked in the driveway. There was a purse and a garage door opener inside. This allowed the intruder(s) access to the garage, and then into the house through a door leading into the kitchen. When the homeowner awoke around 5:00 a.m., he noticed the kitchen and overhead garage doors were both now open. A messenger bag, a laptop computer had been taken from the home. The purse was gone from the car, and his SUV – which had also been parked in the driveway – was missing.   Released 07/18/2018 at 10:33 AM by PIO Joel Despain
