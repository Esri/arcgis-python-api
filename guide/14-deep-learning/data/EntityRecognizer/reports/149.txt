The MPD arrested a 35-year-old woman attempting to enter Jefferson Middle School after she created a loud disruption and made several threats of violence this morning. The woman was unable to get into the school, as she was stopped by school staff at the main entrance for being present on the property without providing staff with advance notice due to past disturbances. After being prevented from entering, staff members said the woman threatened to "shoot up the school," or start it on fire, or drive her car into the front doors. The suspect denied making the statements. She was arrested for disorderly conduct and unlawful trespass.  Released 05/20/2019 at 3:44 PM by PIO Joel Despain
