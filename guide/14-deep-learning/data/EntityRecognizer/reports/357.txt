 Two men reported being attacked in the 400 block of W. Gilman St. early this morning, with one being knocked unconscious. He was taken to a hospital with a possible broken nose. His friend, who was not seriously injured, told police they had spoken with some women in a bar and that their assailants were in the same establishment. He speculated that this group of men, numbering five or six, may not have been happy about the communication the victims had with the women. The victim said, once outside the nightclub, his friend was knocked to the ground and repeatedly struck. He said he was also punched. No suspects have been located.
