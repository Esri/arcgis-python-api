On 7/18/2016, a Madison Police Officer contacted two different victims that reported similar incidents of indecent exposure.  One female complainant described being near the intersection of Whitney Way and Schroeder Road, and as she walked her dog, a silver colored suv (possibly a Saturn Vue) pulled up and asked for the time.  The complainant appropriately continued to walk, as she tried to ignore contact with the male subject who was operating the vehicle.  The persistent male elevated his hips up, and exposed his erect genitalia to the female before driving off on Schroeder Road.  This incident occurred sometime around 6am. Coincidentally enough, a second female was walking her dog near the 2000 block of Danbury Street, and had a similar question posed to her, by a suspect matching the exact description described by the first victim.  The victim did acknowledge the time to be 6:15am, and the suspect elevated his hips in the same fashion, and exposed himself once again.  There is little doubt that the two incidents are connected, and anyone with information, that might further this investigation, is asked to contact the Madison Police.
