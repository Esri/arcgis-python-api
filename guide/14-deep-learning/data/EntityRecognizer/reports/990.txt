 A 53-year-old Madison man was struck in the back of the head and knocked down during an attempted armed robbery Tuesday night in the parking lot of Hy-Vee, 3801 East Washington Ave. Following the attack, the victim was in shock and did not contact the MPD until yesterday. He told an officer he was walking to his car around 6:00 p.m. when someone placed an object to the back of his head. The victim said the stranger threatened to shoot him and demanded his car keys. As the words were spoken, the sounds of a siren - which seemed not far away - pierced the air. This evidently caused the would-be robber to panic. He struck the victim with the object and fled empty-handed with an accomplice. The victim suffered scraped knees, and head soreness. Released 11/16/2017 at 12:05 PM by PIO Joel Despain
