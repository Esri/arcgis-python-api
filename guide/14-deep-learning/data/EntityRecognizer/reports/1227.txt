A prolific west side burglar is back behind bars, this time thanks to images recorded by a homeowner's motion activated video surveillance camera. The victim had it mounted in his Hathaway Dr. garage after having a car stolen earlier this year. When the camera starts to record, there are some blinking lights. The burglar noticed this as he broke in on the night of June 3rd, as he looked right at the camera, and fled without stealing any property. A detective in the MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit immediately recognized the suspect in the video as she has dealt with him on numerous prior burglary cases. There are three prior Incident Reports regarding the suspect. This past Saturday afternoon, members of the West District's Community Police Team set up surveillance near the suspect's home with hopes of arresting him. They spotted the 22-year-old in a car and he was taken into custody - without incident - following a traffic stop on Gammon Road. Released 06/13/2016 at 11:08 AM by PIO Joel Despain
