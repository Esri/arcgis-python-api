A King St. resident was arrested early Saturday morning after he pointed a handgun at an acquaintance while both men were in a common hallway of the suspect's apartment complex. The victim was able to disarm the suspect who was arrested on tentative charges listed above. It was not clear what caused him to act in such away, although he was intoxicated.   (NOTE: There is currently a problem with the Incident Report system template where some addresses are not being accepted by the network. That is why MPD Central District is listed above.) Released 02/05/2018 at 12:51 PM by PIO Joel Despain
