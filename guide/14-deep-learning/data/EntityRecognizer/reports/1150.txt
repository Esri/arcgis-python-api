 A 60-year-old Woodington Way resident was surrounded, pushed and punched outside his home Sunday afternoon. The attack occurred after he tried to let a group of young people know that littering near his home was not appreciated. The victim said a car had parked nearby and a rear passenger tossed an empty food container out of the window. Trash being dumped on, or near his lawn has become frequent lately, so he decided to make a point. He walked over, picked up the container, and placed it back inside the window. "Take your trash with you," he said. Soon, two teens got out, and two more ran over from the grounds of nearby Falk Elementary School. One threatened to "whoop" his posterior. The teens then started pushing the victim with at least one delivering punches. A neighbor saw what was happening, came outside, and began yelling at the teens. They fled in a beige Buick. The MPD is in the process of identifying the car and its occupants. The victim suffered a bloody ear, but declined medical treatment. He told a responding officer the entire episode "kind of ruined my afternoon." Released 04/09/2018 at 2:28 PM by PIO Joel Despain
