 A 26-year-old Madison woman was in a crosswalk, walking her dog, when she was hit by a car last night. She was taken to a hospital with a broken pelvis and broken leg. The pedestrian was crossing Portage Rd., at Donald Dr., when she was hit. The car's driver, a 46-year-old Madison man, did not see the woman until he was just a few feet away from her location. He slammed on the brakes, but could not completely avoid a collision. The driver was very apologetic and concerned for the pedestrian's welfare. There were no signs of impairment. He will be cited for failure to yield to a pedestrian. Released 12/07/2018 at 9:24 AM by PIO Joel Despain
