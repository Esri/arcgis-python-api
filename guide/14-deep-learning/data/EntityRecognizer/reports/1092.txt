Officers responded to the area of North Thompson Drive, near Hwy 30, and the primary reason was to investigate a shots fired call.  Officers contacted three victims, and they described being at a gas station, in the 3000 block of East Washington Avenue, shortly after midnight. While at the gas station, the victims had no significant contact with the occupants of the suspect vehicle, but upon leaving the store, they were immediately followed for more than 40 minutes!  When the victim's vehicle neared North Thompson Drive and Hwy 30, multiple gunshots were heard by the victims; with no reports of injury to anyone.  The victims were eventually able to get away from the suspect(s), as they continued to drive around the east and north sides of the city, and subsequently made a report with The Madison Police Department.  The victims did not believe they had ever seen the suspects before, and definitely did not have an altercation of any sort; to prompt being followed and fired upon.  This matter continues to be investigated by police, as details about the suspects were vague at best.    PO Howard Payne  Released 07/31/2017 at 2:23 PM by P.O.
