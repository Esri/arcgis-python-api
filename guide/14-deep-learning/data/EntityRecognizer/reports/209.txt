On 6/7/2018, between 8:15am-8:30am, an 11-year-old female was walking to the area of Lakeview Elementary School, and noticed a rusty blue van.  The van was occupied by a lone white male, described between 20yrs – 30yrs, and had short blonde hair/facial hair.  The male subject got his vehicle close enough to the child to ask, "Hey little girl, do you want some candy", to which the child said "No" and ran closer to the school; where she knew other adults would be located and to an area she felt was safe.  The child thought the van continued to follow her for a short distance, near Dryden Drive and Browning Road, but drove towards the Tennyson Lane area thereafter. There was some delay in this child enticement case coming to the attention of the Madison Police Department, because there were off campus activities that the 11-year-old female was involved in on this date.  Once police received this information, plans to canvass the area, and conduct extra patrol, were put into place by MPD's North District.  In keeping with how matters of this nature are investigated, we ask the community for any assistance/information that might aid our aims to determine a likely suspect in this case.  Most of the information that police have, at this juncture, has been developed through school officials, but any additional information is always invited. PO Howard Payne  Released 06/07/2018 at 12:58 PM by P.O.
