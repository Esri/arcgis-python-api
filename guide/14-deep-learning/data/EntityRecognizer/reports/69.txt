 Detectives believe two home invaders may have hit the wrong apartment last night following an armed robbery on Petra Place. The men entered through an unlocked door and immediately began wanting to know where the "coke" was kept. A 66-year-old woman had a handgun pointed at her head, while another resident, a 59-year-old man, had his wallet and cell phone taken. Both victims were rattled when officers arrived explaining they do not use or peddle drugs. Released 02/21/2019 at 11:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
