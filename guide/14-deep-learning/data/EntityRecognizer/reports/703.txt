 A homeless man suffered a broken nose and facial cuts requiring sutures after being attacked Saturday night as he stood on S. Carroll St., near West Washington Ave. A witness said the suspect changed shirts following the assault, and did so to "fool the police." The second shirt turned out to be a very recognizable Green Bay Packers jersey, and officers soon spotted the suspect walking near Dayton St.. He told the arresting officer that the victim had bumped him and called him a racial epithet, and that is what provoked the incident. Released 08/29/2016 at 12:11 PM by PIO Joel Despain
