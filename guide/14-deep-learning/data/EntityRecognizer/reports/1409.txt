 A Madison teen was taken into custody Friday afternoon after he stashed a handgun - with a fully loaded 29-round extended magazine - under a bush during a foot chase in the 5800 block of Balsam Rd. The 16-year-old said he is a member of a street gang and carries the weapon for protection. "There are many guns on the street now and people are shooting," he told the arresting officer. The gun is listed as stolen out of DeForest following a May 25th theft from auto case.     Released 06/05/2017 at 11:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
