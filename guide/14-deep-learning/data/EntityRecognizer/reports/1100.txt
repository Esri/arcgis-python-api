 A 22-year-old woman suffered a serious head injury after being pushed and punched inside an Allied Dr. apartment Tuesday night. The victim was knocked down and her head struck a coffee table, causing a significant laceration that exposed a large portion of her skull. Her assailant is a man to whom she is acquainted. He fled as police were called and remains at large. Doctors said the woman would need multiple stitches and plastic surgery after suffering a cut estimated to be 12-inches long.
