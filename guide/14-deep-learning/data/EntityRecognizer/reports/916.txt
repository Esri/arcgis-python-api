For one victim the crime brought back flashbacks and bad memories as she is a past victim of sexual abuse. The 31-year-old was inside the UW Health Clinic at 1 S. Park St. Thursday afternoon when a sweaty man with " a weird smile on his face " began staring at her while committing a lewd and lascivious act. Security staff shared surveillance images of the suspect with responding officers and they immediately knew who the man was as they have arrested him multiple times. The suspect departed before MPD arrived. Central District officers, utilizing downtown surveillance cameras in real time, later spotted the 29-year-old riding a bicycle in the 100 block of W. Mifflin St. They went to that location and took him into custody. A data check showed the man has been arrested at least a dozen times in the past for similar crimes.  Released 04/05/2019 at 10:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
