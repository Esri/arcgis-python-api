MPD officers were dispatched to a residence on the 700 block Fairmont Ave regarding an intoxicated male with a gun.  Kupka was upset because fighter jets were flying over his residence.  The complainant/victim of this incident was an adult female.    Kupka was contacted by officers and resisted arrest.  He was eventually transported to the Dane County Jail on charges of Endangering Safety by use of Dangerous Weapon while under the Influence of an Intoxicant, Domestic Disorderly Conduct, and Resisting.  A .22 cal firearm was recovered at the scene.
