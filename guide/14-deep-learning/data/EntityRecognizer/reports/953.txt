 It was a motion light that went on that caused a 21-year-old Milton St. resident to look up to a second story door of a neighbor's home Friday night. He was outside, and could see there was a stranger at the top of the stairs. "Hey man, what are you doing," yelled the witness. The man said something about just cutting through. He came down and took off running at full gait. The witness gave chase and was able to not only catch up with the older suspect, but knock him down. He then held the trespasser on the ground yelling for someone to call the police. His pleas were heard. Officers were summoned and the man, who has a criminal history for burglary, was arrested.
