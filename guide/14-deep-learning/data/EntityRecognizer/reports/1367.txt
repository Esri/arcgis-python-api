Members of the Central District's Community Police Team came upon a car crash that had just happened at the corner of W. Gorham St. and Wisconsin Ave. early Saturday morning. An intoxicated driver had just run a red light. His car collided with another that was crossing Wisconsin Ave. on a green light. Two people in the victim's car were hurt and taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Meanwhile, the suspect accelerated away from the scene, dragging a front bumper. MPD officers briefly pursued him before shutting down red lights and siren for safety reasons as the suspect went outbound on Johnson Street operating on the wrong side of the road, going an estimated 60 to 70 mph in a construction zone. He hit several construction barrels and signs, and nearly struck an oncoming pickup truck. The suspect ended up going off the road and striking a building located at 312 N. Third Street. Officers and from the MPD and Maple Bluff got into a foot chase with the suspect. A MPD officer was just about to tackle him when the 30-year-old tripped over a sidewalk and went to the ground. He struggled with officers before being taken into custody on multiple tentative charges. Some are listed above.  Released 04/22/2019 at 10:01 AM by PIO Joel Despain
