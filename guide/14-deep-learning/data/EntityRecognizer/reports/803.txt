On 7/17/2016, shortly after 9am, officers responded to a vehicular accident in the northbound lanes of Hwy 51, just south of Cottage Grove Road.  Officers found a green Ford Explorer at the scene, that had struck a concrete guard rail and bridge support, but were also advised, by the Dane County 911 Center, that two male subjects had fled the accident location. Based on proximity to the accident, officers located one subject, identified as Larry Simms, a short distance away.  Simms was detained, and witnesses described the SUV that Simms was driving as 'operating at a high rate of speed just moments before the crash.'  As officers investigated this crash, they quickly made a connection to a number of vehicle thefts from a used car dealership in the 3000 block of East Washington Avenue; which had been reported to police just one hour before this accident occurred.  Officers questioned the sobriety of the driver, and Simms was taken into custody on a variety of charges.  This matter continues to be investigated, as more than 10 vehicles were reported stolen from the used car dealership in the previous 12 hours leading up to this crash, and it is thought that there could be many more vehicles and individuals that might be connected to the thefts from the dealership.  PO Howard Payne      Released 07/18/2016 at 12:37 PM by P.O.
