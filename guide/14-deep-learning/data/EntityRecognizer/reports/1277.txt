 A parent of a downtown resident contacted the MPD this past Sunday after her son reported being robbed the night prior. The 19-year-old told police he was home alone, inside his E. Gorham St. apartment, when four men entered through an unlocked door. He said at least three carried handguns and all had bandanas covering their faces. The victim said he was pushed down as the intruders rifled through the apartment, leaving with a gaming system, his wallet and cell phone. The victim's two roommates were not at home at the time of the robbery. He did not have a good answer as to why he did not contact police following the home invasion, and did not know why his apartment had been targeted. He did say that he had hosted a large house party Friday night and did not personally know all who attended. Released 03/16/2016 at 10:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
