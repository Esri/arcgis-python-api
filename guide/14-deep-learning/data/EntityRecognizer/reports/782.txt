A MPD detective arrested a 16-year-old LaFollette High School student Wednesday for repeated sexual assault of a child. A 15-year-old girl told the MPD she was repeatedly and forcefully groped over the course of a couple of weeks this past February and that these incidents took place in several areas of the school. The victim suffered pain and soreness following a couple of the incidents. She became fearful of attending classes, and did not attend at times. Released 04/25/2019 at 1:21 PM by PIO Joel Despain
