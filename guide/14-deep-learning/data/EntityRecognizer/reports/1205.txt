 The MPD arrested a 16-year-old girl for battery to a public transit operator after she grabbed the arms of a Madison Metro Bus driver and pulled the driver by the hair. At the time of the assault, the driver had stopped her bus on W. Broadway in an attempt to break up a fight between two other girls. Video shows the 16-year-old trying to stop the bus driver from intervening so that the fight might continue. In the end, the driver prevailed. The teens fled the bus. The 16-year-old was located and arrested. A 13-year-old girl, who was part of the original fight, was also cited for battery and disorderly conduct. Released 01/17/2019 at 9:16 AM by PIO Joel Despain
