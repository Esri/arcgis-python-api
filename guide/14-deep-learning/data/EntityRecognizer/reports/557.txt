 An 11-year-old girl said a stranger in a car called her a "cutie" and appeared to follow her Monday afternoon as she walked near Heritage Heights Park, 701 Meadowlark Dr. The child contacted a friend's parent, who lives in the area, and the adult walked the girl home. The child said the man drove off as she made contact with the adult. Released 05/02/2018 at 11:24 AM by PIO Joel Despain
