 A Brompton Circle resident returned home last night, and had just stepped out of her van, when an armed man approached. He was brandishing a small knife and demanded she turn over her cell phone. The woman gave him her gray iPhone 8 housed in a rose-colored case. The robber fled on foot. A police dog could not find him. The victim was in tears and badly shaken when police arrived.
