The victim said she was about to call 911 early this morning, but stopped when she saw the MPD was already on scene and pulling over a man who had just made obscene gestures and unwanted solicitations. The 20-year-old downtown resident had been walking in the 700 block of State St., a pedestrian only area. Officers did not witness the contact between suspect and victim, but did see the man driving in Library Mall, where cars are prohibited. They had just pulled the man over, on nearby University Ave., when the victim walked up to explain what else had happened – beyond the motorist's poor driving decisions. She said he had been offering her a ride, and began thrusting his index finger - on one hand - into the fist of the other. He yelled out, "You wanna go do this?" The victim told him to "get away." He responded by making more lewd gestures, this time with his hips. She was  about to pull out her cell phone and call police when she saw they were already on his tail. The suspect was cited for disorderly conduct for his behavior and several traffic violations for his driving.  Released 01/06/2017 at 11:31 AM by PIO Joel Despain
