 A 22-year-old Madison man was arrested Monday for carrying a concealed handgun and possession with intent to deliver heroin. Adonius E. Paul, age 22, was taken into custody without incident in the 1100 block of S. Park St. by members of the Dane County Narcotics Task Force (DCNET) and the MPD's Gang Unit. The investigation into Paul began on February 6th when a MPD Traffic Enforcement Safety Team (TEST) officer pulled over for speeding car in the 1900 block of Fish Hatchery Rd. Paul was a passenger in the car. It smelled of marijuana. The gun and heroin were located during a search, but Paul fled the scene prior to the weapon and drugs being located. DCNET was able to conclude the drugs and gun were his, and they began looking for Paul. Released 02/20/2019 at 3:19 PM by PIO Joel Despain
