A kind citizen turned in a wallet, that appears to belong to a child.  The citizen dropped it off, at the Welcome Center, in the 100 block of State St.  The wallet is very distinctive and it appears that it was recently lost.  If you believe that you know the owner of the wallet, please call to identify it and the contents. The Officer would like to return it to the rightful owner.  Please call 266-4730, to identify. Released 05/29/2017 at 7:23 PM by Lt. Kelly Donahue
