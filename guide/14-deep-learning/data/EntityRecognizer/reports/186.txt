One suspect claimed he and his brother had driven some 60 miles from Fox Lake, WI to the Watts Rd. Walmart simply to use the bathroom. However, loss prevention officers told police Walmart's collective Wisconsin radar was up for the brothers as they are believed to be dumpster divers and trash pickers. Store security said the brothers are alleged to be snatching receipts tossed outside Walmart stores - into trash cans and dumpsters - by legitimate customers. They then come into stores - with ill-gotten receipts - find matching merchandise and "return" items for cash. Such was the case last night, as staff members said both brothers pulled off described transactions just before police were called. One, Jesse Farber, age 25, had seven Walmart receipts in his wallet; 18 more were seized from the van in which the brothers had been road tripping. They were from several Walmart stores including those located in Madison, Sun Prairie, Monona and Fond du Lac. Hypodermic needles and other drug related items were also found in the van.
