 Two of MPD's trained crisis negotiators were able to get an angry and distraught 15-year-old to drop a kitchen knife following a violent domestic disturbance that took place inside a Brentwood Parkway apartment last Thursday morning.  The young man had punched and pushed family members before grabbing the weapon and swinging it within a foot of a victim. The victim needed to back pedal to avoid being slashed or stabbed. Officers were told the teen was "going crazy with a knife." They ventured inside the unit, taking positions in the entryway, fearing for the safety of those in the apartment. One officer had his service weapon drawn; the other his electronic control device. The teen, his muscles clenched, took a fighting stance. "Put the knife down man, just put the knife down," urged one officer. The suspect responded: "Why do you got the gun out?" "I attempted to reassure him that we did not want to hurt him, that we were armed because we did not with anyone to be hurt, but he was holding a knife and we could not take chances," wrote an officer, in the report he would later file. After a couple of minutes inside the apartment, officers convinced the teen to put the knife down. It would take several more minutes of negotiating – in a calm voice - to convince him to be peacefully handcuffed. Released 01/17/2017 at 12:04 PM by PIO Joel Despain
