 Responding officers recovered a discarded .22 rifle following a road-rage incident late Sunday morning. They were called to Mid Town Rd. at S. High Point Rd. after a 36-year-old Madison man reported seeing a gun pointed out of the passenger window of a vehicle. He and another motorist had been honking their horns trying to get the car containing the armed person to move after it sat for several minutes in front of them at a stop sign. Following the gun incident, the victim began following the suspect's car, at a safe distance, while calling police. He lost sight of it, and the gun was recovered about a half mile away from that point, in the median at McKee Rd. and Snowy Parkway. Released 03/26/2018 at 9:49 AM by PIO Joel Despain
