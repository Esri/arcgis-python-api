Park St. The victim said three men approached; one pointed a gun at him; another grabbed him by the neck, and he ended up on the ground. Once down, he was kicked in the head. The robbers took cash from his pockets and fled on foot. A police dog was brought to the scene but no suspects were located. Released 07/10/2017 at 9:16 AM by PIO Joel Despain
