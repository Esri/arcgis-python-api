Many shoppers clapped their hands and praised police as multiple officers were sent into West Towne Mall Saturday afternoon to successfully stop an attack on a Madison couple. Earlier, suspects had harassed victims on a Madison Metro bus. One teen threw candy at the male victim and later dumped a slushy drink on the couple. In the chaos of the moment, the male victim realized his brand new cell phone was missing. The couple pursued the suspects into West Towne Mall with hopes of getting it returned. Instead, several teens encircled the male victim. As police arrived, the suspects were in boxer stances, jumping around in the middle of the mall throwing punches as the victim rope-a-doped and tried to protect himself from injury. A teenage girl also slapped and punched the man's girlfriend. The young people all ran as police arrived, but officers were able to corral all but one. Several teens are well known to the MPD and are members of a gang. Much of the violence was captured on surveillance video.  Released 11/12/2018 at 11:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
