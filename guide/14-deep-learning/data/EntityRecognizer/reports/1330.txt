 A 14-year-old girl was using the restroom at Burlington Coat Factory, 2025 Zeier Rd., Thursday afternoon when she noticed the person in the next stall slide a cell phone under the stall she was using. The child got out of the bathroom, and notified her mother. The mother waited several minutes outside of the women's restroom door until a man came out.  She confronted him, asking if he had been recording images of her child. He said no, and immediately left the store, driving off in a gray sedan with Wisconsin plates.    Released 03/29/2019 at 9:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
