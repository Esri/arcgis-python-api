 A Madison father walking with his 5-year-old son near the Capitol Square Saturday night became very fearful for their safety after a man - just 10 feet away - began swinging a knife. The suspect had just punched another man during a disturbance involving several people. He then pulled the knife, and later told police he wanted to kill the victim. The victim ended up with a minor cut from the punch. The suspect, who had an eight inch knife in a pocket, went to jail. He blew a .32 while taking a breathalyzer test.  Released 12/14/2015 at 11:13 AM by PIO Joel Despain
