A member of the Guardian Angels saw a man acting suspiciously near a large outdoor flower planter on W. Gilman St. early Sunday morning. The witness checked the planter and found hidden three women's wallets. None had money or credit cards left, but two had identification inside. Owners were contacted, and both women – one age 25, the other age 26 - said they had been out socializing in the State St. area. Neither immediately realized their wallet had been lifted from their purse. Released 04/03/2017 at 11:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
