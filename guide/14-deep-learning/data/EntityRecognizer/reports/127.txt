 The weapon looks like an AK-47, and a 14-year-old Madison teen took a picture of himself pointing it at a camera. He then sent the photo to another teen via social media, threatening to harm the boy and his family if the victim did not give the suspect drugs and money. The victim told a trusted adult about the threat and the MPD was contacted. Officers went to the suspect's home yesterday and placed him under arrest after recovering an airsoft rifle, drug paraphernalia, and marijuana from his bedroom. He was taken to the Juvenile Reception Center.   Released 10/25/2017 at 10:31 AM by PIO Joel Despain
