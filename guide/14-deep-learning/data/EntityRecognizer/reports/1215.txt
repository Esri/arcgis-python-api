It was a property damage call. Three mail boxes on Dregers Way had been struck by a car sometime Monday. An investigating officer spoke with neighbors who indicated the driver lived nearby, and had told one of them he had recently changed medications that made him sleepy. He said that was the reason he hit the mailboxes and he fully intended to pay for damages. The MPD officer went to the man's home, rang the door bell and got no response. She peeked in a window, and could see the 28-year-old was down on a hallway floor. His eyes were closed. He was gasping for air and his chest was rising abnormally high. Realizing the man was in dire need of medical help, the officer went to her squad, grabbed her wooden baton, and broke out a window near the front door. She cleared the shattered glass, unlocked the door, and quickly determined the man was now without a pulse. She began chest compressions. The officer checked again, and found a slight pulse. She continued life-saving measures until Madison Fire paramedics arrived. Because of her due diligence - on what started as a property damage call - the officer saved a life and will be nominated for departmental award. Released 03/07/2017 at 9:19 AM by PIO Joel Despain
