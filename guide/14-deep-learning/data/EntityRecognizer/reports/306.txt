Three years ago, he was one of several men arrested following a series of area armed robberies. Yesterday the 28-year-old was taken into custody again by the MPD after he fought with loss prevention officers during a felony retail theft at Target, 4301 Lien Rd. The suspect had just pushed more than $700 worth of merchandise out the door when he was contacted. Security staff members recognized him as the same person who stole $1,300 worth of electronics from their store this past Monday. Yesterday, the suspect struggled with the employees, before pulling out of his sweatshirt and sprinting shirtless to an awaiting getaway vehicle. Victims were able to provide police with a good description of it, and the SUV was later pulled over by the MPD on South Thompson Drive. The suspect and the driver were both arrested on tentative charges that are listed above.   Released 04/04/2019 at 11:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
