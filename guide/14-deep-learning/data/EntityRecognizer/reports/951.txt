 A Madison teen told police he was shooting baskets behind Frank Allis Elementary School, on the last day of spring break, when two older teens approached and pushed him down. He remembers "waking up" and believes he was knocked unconscious. A small amount of money was missing from his pocket. The boy was unable to provide detailed descriptions of his attackers.
