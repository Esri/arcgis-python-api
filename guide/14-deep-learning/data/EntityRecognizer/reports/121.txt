The night clerk is sitting at the front desk of the Super 8 Motel when the two suspects enter the lobby area.  One suspect pretends to watch TV, while the other one approaches the desk and asks about a room.  When the clerk starts checking his computer, the suspect draws a handgun.  The clerk then fled into a back room and called 911.  It's believed the suspects checked the desk area for valuables before fleeing the area.  The investigation is on-going at this time.  Released 03/26/2019 at 4:56 AM by Sgt.
