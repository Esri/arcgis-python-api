MPD officers were sent to the 7000 bl of Flower Ln for loud noise stemming from a party.  Upon their arrival the officers were outside the apartment when information was received which required their making entry.  Inside they made contact with a 30-yr old male acting belligerently after having come back into the apartment from the balcony.  This individual was uncooperative and officers needed to deploy an electronic control device (ECD) on him, which enabled them to take him into custody.  He was not injured by the ECD deployment but did have injuries from an altercation he had been in prior to officers making contact with him.  A stolen handgun was found outside the balcony where the suspect had been, and probable cause was developed that this suspect had been in possession of it inside the apartment.  The suspect identified himself to officers using a different name, but was positively identified at the Dane County Public Safety Building after being cleared medically at a local hospital.  He declined to provide information as to whom he had been in the altercation with.  The suspect was charged with Possession of a Stolen Firearm, Disorderly Conduct, Resisting an Officer, and Obstructing an Officer.  He also had an outstanding warrant for his arrest for Failure to Pay Child Support.       Released 06/23/2019 at 10:15 AM by Lt.
