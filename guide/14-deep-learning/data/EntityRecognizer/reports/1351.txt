 he manager of a local Walgreens recently helped shutdown a fraud attempt and in the process saved a 59-year-old Madison woman from losing nearly $300. The victim had gone to the store and asked what MoneyPak prepaid cards were the ones used to pay Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) bills. She had gotten a call from someone posing as a MGE employee. The con artist told her a technician would soon be on the way to her W. Lakeview Ave. home to disconnect power due to unpaid bills. The only way to prevent this would be for the victim to purchase MoneyPak cards. She went to the Walgreens nearest her home and told an employee what she needed. The employee contacted a manager, and the manager told the woman MGE would not send someone to Walgreens to purchase MoneyPak gift cards for payment of an electrical bill. The woman called MGE from Walgreens and a real company employee confirmed this was indeed a scam, and a fairly common one at that. When the con artist called the woman back, hoping to get Moneypak numbers, she gave him a couple of choice words and hung up. Released 07/31/2018 at 9:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
