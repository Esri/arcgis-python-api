 Officers were sent to a townhouse on Odana Lane last night for reports of a disturbance and fight. When they got to the location they heard three gunshots. The reports appeared to have come from behind the building. There were no reports of injuries or property damage. Witnesses told officers there had been an argument between two men inside the townhouse. Punches were thrown, and one of the men had gone outside just as officers arrived. The MPD located and arrested this person for disorderly conduct. He is also a person of interest in the shots being fired. Officers are still investigating and have not yet located a gun.
