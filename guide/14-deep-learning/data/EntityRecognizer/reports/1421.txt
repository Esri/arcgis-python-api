Officers were dispatched to reports of shots being fired in the parking lot of Kipp Corp.  Officers did not locate any suspects or victims at the scene, but did locate shell casings and blood.  A victim later arrived at a local hospital with a gunshot wound.  The wound is not considered life threatening.  The investigation is still on-going at this time.  Released 06/14/2018 at 4:01 AM by Sgt.
