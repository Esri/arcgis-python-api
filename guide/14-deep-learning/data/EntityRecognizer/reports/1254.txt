An intoxicated shoplifter, who told security staff members he had a gun, was arrested at the West Transfer Point Wednesday after stealing a bottle of booze and a stuffed pink walrus from nearby Copps, 620 S. Whitney Way. A pair of store loss prevention professionals tried to stop him as he fled. The suspect reached for his waistband, and announced: " I'm gonna shoot you both." It turned out he had no gun and was arrested on tentative charges listed above. Released 08/18/2016 at 12:20 PM by PIO Joel Despain
