Madison Police were sent to the 2900 block of Hermina Street, searching for a wanted female, later identified as Heather Parks.  Information had been developed that a female, wearing a pink top, leggings, and a black sleeve covering a cheetah tattoo was in/around this area.  Officers began to make inquiry at a specific residence, and determined that a male resident, who seemed surreptitious in his response about Park's whereabouts, emphatically stated that Parks had previously been at this location, but was now gone.  An officer looked on the opposite side of the residence, and saw a female running; a female that was wearing a sleeve and pink top.  Commands to stop by police were blatantly disregarded, and officers continued to give chase.  The foot pursuit continued across/down Hermina Street, and officers were able to close the 40-yard head start that Parks was able to attain.  Parks was decentralized and taken into custody.  PO Howard Payne    Released 08/17/2017 at 11:53 AM by P.O.
