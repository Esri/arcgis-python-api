 A 77-year-old Madison woman was convinced last week that her grandson was in jail, and in need of her help. The story she got from a caller was that her grandson fled the scene of a car crash, and was now in need of bail money. She followed instructions, and went to Walmart where she placed $1,000 on MoneyCard. She next provided the card's numbers to the caller. After realizing she had been swindled, she called the MPD.
