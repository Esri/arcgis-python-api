 The MPD was called to the 200 block of N. Thompson Dr. early yesterday morning after a stolen car was found abandoned in the middle of the street. The gas tank was empty. The interior reeked of pot smoke. Someone had burned letters into the upholstery. There was damage to the front bumper and left quarter panel, and a spare tire was affixed to one of the rims. Headrests, the rearview mirror, and the glove box had all been removed and were now in the trunk. There was a temporary Wisconsin plate taped to the back window, and the victim's license plates were nowhere to be found. The car had been stolen on New Year's Eve after a 38-year-old Swanton Rd. resident left it unlocked and running as she dashed inside to get a shopping list. A police officer called her yesterday to let her know the good and bad news. He went to pick her up at her home, and took her to a gas station for some fuel. Once behind the wheel, she said the steering felt really rough, and there were likely to be a lot of other issues to be diagnosed. She had purchased the car for $18,000 and was still making payments. Thankfully she is insured. Released 01/11/2018 at 11:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
