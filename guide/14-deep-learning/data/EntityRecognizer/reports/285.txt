 At least 11 people were struck by paintballs as a van containing five men drove around and fired rounds from a paintball gun in several parts of the greater Madison area Sunday afternoon. Incidents were reported from South Gammon Road to University Avenue, and from South Park Street to East Washington Avenue. The suspect van was stopped on Fish Hatchery Rd. just before 6:00 p.m. after a witness – who was following the van – updated a 911 communicator about its direction of travel. Five suspects were arrested. A paintball rifle was seized, as were several hundred blue paintballs. Several victims suffered welts during the crime spree. Town of Madison Police, Fitchburg Police, and Monona Police assisted the MPD in the apprehensions. Released 05/29/2018 at 11:55 AM by PIO Joel Despain
