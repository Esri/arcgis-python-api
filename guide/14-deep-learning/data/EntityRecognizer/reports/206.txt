A Madison banker got a strange call on his personal phone while at work last week, and it appears he was targeted by overseas criminals trying out a new scam. When the 29-year-old answered his phone, he could hear a girl crying and saying something unintelligible. A gruff voice can be heard saying, "Hand me the phone!" A male voice then gets on the call addressing the Madison banker by his first name. The criminal says he has the banker's daughter, and that ransom money is going to be needed to earn her freedom. The businessman tells the caller he does not have a daughter, and the call disconnects. The call appears to have originated in India. The banker thought it prudent to notify the MPD in case others – perhaps some who do have daughters – get similar disturbing calls. Released 04/18/2017 at 10:18 AM by PIO Joel Despain
