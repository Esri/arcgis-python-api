 A Madison teen told police he was jumped by four men while walking on Hoard St. late Saturday morning. He said the men were with a woman with whom he is somewhat acquainted. He was struck with fists and something resembling a police-style baton. When the battery was over, the woman took his tennis shoes. Limping from the beating, and in his socks, he sought help at the Goodman Center, 149 Waubesa St. The teen was sore but declined medical attention. Released 06/07/2016 at 12:06 PM by PIO Joel Despain
