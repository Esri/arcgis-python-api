 A 46-year-old man used Facebook Marketplace to find a buyer for his Mac mini. After corresponding over the internet, he arranged to meet someone who appeared to be a female on Prairie Ave. Saturday afternoon. When seller arrived, someone who identified himself as the brother of the purchaser approached. He wanted to check the computer out to make sure it worked prior to his sister turning over cash. The seller and the young man both had hands on the computer, when the computer was ripped from the victim's grasp. He chased after the strong-armed robber, but lost him when he slipped and fell.
