MPD K9 Falko tracked down a home burglary suspect last night after picking up her scent from sneakers she left inside the victims' home. Officers were called to a Waunona Way residence for a burglary in progress after a 59-year-old woman heard an intruder break into the basement. The victim locked herself in a bedroom, and her husband arrived home moments later to confront the suspect. She had cut her hand while breaking a basement window, and it was now wrapped in a towel. The 35-year-old fled barefoot down the street. K9 Falko arrived, and was presented with one of the suspect's shoes. The police dog was then given the command to track. K9 Falko led officers through some backyards and woods before lying down near another neighborhood home. The suspect resides at the address. She was located inside and arrested. The victims did not believe anything was taken during the burglary as the crime had been interrupted. Released 02/13/2018 at 9:45 AM by PIO Joel Despain
