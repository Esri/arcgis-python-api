Members of the MPD's West District's Community Police Team, working with the Dane County Task Force, took a loaded handgun off of a convicted felon as part of a violence reduction initiative Wednesday night. Officers made contact with the suspect after he remained parked for a period of time in the lot of a gas station without buying gas or going inside to make a purchase. While talking with the suspect, who was in the driver's seat, an officer noticed the grip of a handgun sticking out of the man's coat pocket. It turned out to be a 9mm Smith & Wesson with 16 rounds in the magazine. The suspect was arrested and the handgun seized.  Released 11/09/2017 at 9:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
