 Early Sunday morning, several young burglars went running out the backside of Toys "R" Us, 7309 West Towne Way. One, upon arrest, would later tell an officer that they used a rock to break a window, unlock a door, and go inside.  When they saw flashlights outside, they assumed the MPD had arrived, and they took off. Officers were able to catch four, including one who was trying to scale a fence near the beltline. He was told it would best to come down unless he wanted a police dog to intervene. He chose to stop his flight. The teens said they intended to steal items, but took off empty-handed when police showed up. Released 09/26/2016 at 1:37 PM by PIO Joel Despain
