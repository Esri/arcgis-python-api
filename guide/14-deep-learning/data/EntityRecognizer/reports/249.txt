The Madison Police Department arrested a 59-year-old Madison man last night for the first degree murder of his wife, and for blowing up their home in an attempt to cover up the homicide. Steven D. Pirus is accused of shooting to death Lee Anne Pirus, age 50. Investigators believe the crime took place weeks, or even months ago. On September 13th, Steven Pirus is accused of intentionally causing his home to explode by manipulating the natural gas system. The body of Lee Anne Pirus was inside at the time. There were many neighbors in the area at the time of the explosion, and their lives were placed at risk. Because of this, Steven Pirus has also been arrested for first degree recklessly endangering safety. That tentative charge is in addition to first degree intentional homicide and arson.   Released 09/17/2017 at 3:19 PM by PIO Joel Despain
