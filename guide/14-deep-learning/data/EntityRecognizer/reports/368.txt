On 3/7/2018, shortly after 9:03pm, a Madison Police Officer happened to be right outside the Irish Pub, located at 317 State Street.  The officer noted hearing loud yelling and the sounds of a disturbance coming from within the bar, and he started moving towards the front of the establishment to figure out what was happening.  Suddenly a male subject, later identified as Brian P. Smith, exited the bar; with other bystanders directing the officer's attention to Smith as the presumed problem. Staff members stated that Smith had gone out to smoke a cigarette, but returned with it lit; citing that he thought he was still in Illinois and he didn't know it was illegal to smoke inside of a bar.  That explanation fell short, as he refused to leave the bar when asked, and continued using colorful expletives.   Smith refused to stop for the investigative officer who was attempting to deal with the matter.  After the exceptionally inebriated Smith continued to display his middle finger to observers, the officer knew this situation would involve a proactive approach; to keep Smith from creating other problems in the area. Surprisingly enough, Smith did not want to cooperate with the officer, and it took the officer to get into a physical altercation before Smith could be taken into custody.  Smith attempted to kick and spit on officers, but was soon transferred to the Dane County Jail on all listed charges. PO Howard Payne  Released 03/09/2018 at 1:47 PM by P.O.
