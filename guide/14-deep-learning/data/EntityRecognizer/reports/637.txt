A minute before midnight on Wednesday officers were dispatched to a local motel for a disturbance. Staff at the hotel advised they could hear a female yelling in pain and something hitting the door of the hotel room. Officers made contact with both occupants of the room, who both had non-life threatening injuries. Both parties were transported to UW hospital for treatment and after investigation officers arrested Ronald McCane for disorderly conduct, substantial battery and false imprisonment.
