 The MPD is investigating a home burglary on Prairie Rd. It was reported Sunday night, but it has not been determined when the break in occurred over the weekend as homeowners were out of town. A door between the garage and house was kicked in. It appears items were stolen, but specifics were not yet known at the time the investigating officer filed a report.    Released 02/19/2018 at 11:49 AM by PIO Joel Despain
