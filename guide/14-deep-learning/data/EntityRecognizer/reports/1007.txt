 A group of children are believed responsible for significant weekend vandalism at Falk Elementary School, 6323 Woodington Way. Officers responded to an alarm Saturday afternoon and found numerous outside windows smashed, some by brick pavers that had been in the school's garden. Garden tools were also found near some of the shattered glass. Inside, cleaning and food products were dumped on many floors and in several classrooms. Surveillance images indicate five or six children, all males, entered through broken windows. The MPD is in the process of identifying them. Released 06/19/2017 at 12:24 PM by PIO Joel Despain
