 Two 10-year-old girls reported a stranger offering them candy Monday evening after he pulled up next to them as they walked on Dapin Road. They did not respond and instead ran. They said the man (see description above) was driving a white pickup truck. It had rust, an orange light on top of the cab and metal poles, tools and orange cones in the bed.
