An alert citizen called for police Wednesday afternoon after spotting a young man go into a minivan that was at the gas pumps outside of a PDQ store, 7717 Mineral Point Rd. The driver had gone into pay, and the young man was grabbing what he could from the van. The witness provided details about a getaway car, and officers spotted it in the West Towne Mall parking lot. There were three teens inside, and as the MPD went to pull it over, the driver took off fast, blowing stop signs and red lights in the midst of heavy traffic. The MPD did not pursue out of concern for everyone's safety. However, the car was soon spotted again. This time the teens decided to abandon it near WMTV, 615 Forward Dr. They took off on foot and were chased down by officers. The young men were in possession of several items that were likely stolen, including a debit card and an Apple iPad. They were also identified as suspects in a theft where a 10-year-old boy had a bag of food and dog treats ripped from his hand as he left the BP gas station, 5445 University Ave., earlier that afternoon. The car the suspects were driving was stolen from a driveway on Waterford Rd. on November 18th. A 36-year-old Minnesota woman had left it unlocked, with the keys inside. She was in town, visiting family, and thought the car may have needed to be moved before going to bed. She then forgot to lock it up.   Released 11/27/2017 at 9:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
