 The Dane County Narcotics Task Force seized heroin, cocaine and marijuana - with a street value of more than $100,000 -  following a traffic stop and search of a Whitman Lane apartment last Thursday. The target of the investigation, Anthony L. Nance, age 28, Madison was arrested when the car he was driving was pulled over on the W. Beltline Highway near Stoughton Rd. Shortly thereafter a search warrant was served on Nance's apartment. Drugs, more than $5,700 cash, cell phones, digital scales and other items were recovered. Nance is on probation for a 2016 drug and gun case.  Released 06/17/2019 at 10:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
