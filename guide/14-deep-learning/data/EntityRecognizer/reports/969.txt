Officers responded to an area hospital for a report of a stabbing.  MPD contacted the victim,  who had a large (13") laceration to his side and a stab wound to his head.  The injuries were serious, but non-life threatening. Victim stated his sister got into an altercation with the suspect's girlfriend.  Upon his attempt to intervene, the suspect quickly advanced on him asking if he wanted to fight.  Victim declined, and put his hands up when the suspect pulled a knife and began striking the victim with it causing his injuries.   Investigation continues.   Released 07/30/2017 at 8:02 AM by Sgt.
