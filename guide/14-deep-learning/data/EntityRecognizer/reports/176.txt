Several callers reported hearing multiple shots fired in the 700 block of Bewick Drive.  There was extreme rain/flooding in the area, and responding officers were not able to locate any shell casings.  There were no reports of property damage or injury as a result of the fired rounds.  After interviews were completed, it was thought that a small caliber handgun was used, as witnesses described a black firearm.  Several suspects were seen running in the area, just after the firearm was discharged, but after officers canvassed the neighborhood and had a Maple Bluff K9 to assist in the search, no suspects were ever located.   PO Howard Payne Released 08/18/2017 at 11:31 AM by P.O.
