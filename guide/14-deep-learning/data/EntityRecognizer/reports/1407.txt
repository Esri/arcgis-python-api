The MPD recovered two handguns hidden in the closet of a Vera Ct. apartment following a weapons call late Monday afternoon. A woman said there was a man inside the residence who had just pointed one at her during an argument. The suspect told police there were no firearms in the apartment, but that turned out not to be true. He was arrested.  Released 01/26/2016 at 11:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
