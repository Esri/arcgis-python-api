 What witnesses thought was a knife turned out to be a sharp-edged, flip-out style bottle opener. Wednesday night, a 36-year-old man was swinging it wildly at a victim who had intervened in a dispute the suspect was having with a woman near the intersection of N. Frances St. and State St. The victim received a minor shoulder cut during the attack. He defended himself by delivering a couple of punches. One caused a chin cut to the suspect. He needed stitches before going to jail on tentative charges of second degree reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct. Released 06/16/2016 at 9:51 AM by PIO Joel Despain
