 The MPD was called to a Spaight St. apartment building early this morning after a concerned neighbor heard loud banging and someone yelling for help. After entering the building, a MPD officer came upon an armed man, who is a resident of the building. The officer - with his service weapon drawn - ordered the suspect to drop the weapon. Fortunately, he did. Investigators found several casings inside the suspect's bathroom and determined he had fired at least one round into a wall. Officers canvassed the building and did not find anyone to be injured, or find that any bullets had penetrated other apartments. The gunman - who was showing signs of paranoia - was taken to a hospital for a blood draw. He will be facing tentative charges to include reckless endangering safety.
