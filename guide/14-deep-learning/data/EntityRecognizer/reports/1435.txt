 A mother was walking with her 9-year-old child last night near the intersection of Schroeder Rd. and S. Gammon Rd. when a four-door red car sped past. There was someone inside shooting paintballs and one hit the youngster in the back causing a welt.  Released 08/14/2018 at 10:06 AM by PIO Joel Despain
