A City of Madison Parking Enforcement Officer came across an automobile originally reported stolen from the 1400 Block of Morrison St on June 21, 2016.  The vehicle was unoccupied and was parked in the lot to Riley's Wines of the World.  When Officers arrived on scene, witnesses pointed out that the vehicle occupants were still in the area.  When contact was attempted with these subjects, Dunlap fled and after a short foot pursuit he was apprehended.  Witnesses identified Dunlap as the driver of the vehicle, and it is believed the two occupants had no knowledge that the vehicle was stolen.  Arrangements are being made with the vehicle's owner to return the vehicle.
