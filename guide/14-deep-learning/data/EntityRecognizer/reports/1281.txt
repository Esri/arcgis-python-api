A Madison woman was outside, near her home on Goodland Dr. last night, when a man grabbed her cell phone and punched her in the face. He took off, and she followed, demanding he give her phone back. The suspect punched the woman in the head a second time. She yelled for passersby to call 911, which they did. The victim pointed to an apartment on Troy Dr. and told officers that was where the robber had gone. He was located and arrested. He had the woman's phone, but it was now destroyed. The victim did not know the suspect by name but said she had encountered him in the neighborhood a couple of times in recent months.  Released 04/03/2018 at 9:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
