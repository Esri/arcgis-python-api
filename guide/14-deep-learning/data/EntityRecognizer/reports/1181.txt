A 26-year-old Madison man, out for a run last night, was punched in the face by a stranger in the 2000 block of Winnebago St. The victim says he was on his normal exercise route when he encountered the other man. The man delivered a haymaker that left the victim with a possible broken nose, swollen eye and bloody face. The injured man said his assailant said nothing, did not try to rob him, and fled across the street following the assault. Released 08/24/2016 at 9:31 AM by PIO Joel Despain
