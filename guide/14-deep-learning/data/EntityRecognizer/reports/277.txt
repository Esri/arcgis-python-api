 A concerned citizen reached into a crashed car on E. Washington Ave. early Sunday morning and removed the ignition key as a drunken driver attempted drive from the scene. The concerned citizen, a 34-year-old Marshall man, was on his way home from work when he came upon a two car crash. He went to check on the welfare of those involved and found the suspect behind the wheel. The driver said he was not injured, and got out to relieve himself. He then got back in the car, and was attempting to start it, when the Marshall man intervened. "No, no, don't do that," the concerned citizen said as he reached in to remove keys from the ignition. The driver then got out and took off as police were called. Officers spotted him running between houses on Fourth St. and were able to take him into custody on tentative charges listed above.    Released 03/13/2017 at 10:58 AM by PIO Joel Despain
