 Two MPD officers were injured Sunday afternoon, with one being punched in the head while a drunken driver tried to disarm the male officer. A female officer suffered a hand injury, and the MPD is grateful for the help provided by a couple of concerned citizens. They came to the officers' aid as the out of control suspect resisted arrest. Minutes earlier, witnesses said the De Forest man was driving all over Portage Rd., and at one point was operating on the sidewalk. A pedestrian took cover behind a telephone pole and called 911, fearing the driver was going to kill someone. The suspect ended up crashing into a light pole in the parking lot of a East Washington Ave. hotel. The 39-year-old took off running, and again, it was concerned citizens, who pointed to his hiding place: near dumpsters behind a fast-food restaurant. The suspect failed to follow officers' orders and instead fought with them. One needed stitches to close a wound above an eye after being punched. He did everything he could to prevent the suspect from taking his service weapon, which was in the officer's hand. The female officer injured her thumb trying to get the suspect off of the male officer. A couple of citizens joined in the struggle: one helped hold down the suspect's legs, while the other helped hold down the suspect's hands. The driver was ultimately taken to jail on a host of tentative charges. They are listed above. Released 01/23/2017 at 11:45 AM by PIO Joel Despain
