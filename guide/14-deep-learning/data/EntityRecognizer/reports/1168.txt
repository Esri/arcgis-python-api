On 6/7/2018, shortly after 828am, Madison Police responded to the 7900 block of Tree Lane reference a burglary of the Heid Music Store.  Officers located a broken window, and after canvassing the business, found a display case that was also found to be damaged; a case that once housed a valuable guitar.  It would be determined that up to 4 different "High quality" guitars had been stolen from the store, and burglary tools were also located by police.  These kinds of cases are horrible for a store owner, the immediate community, and our city as a whole.  In keeping with what The Madison Police Department has asked of anyone with information about this crime, or any other, contacting Crime Stoppers at (608) 266- 6014 is a good option to submit a tip.  Those providing information, which leads to an arrest, may be entitled to compensation, and anyone using this option will have their identity remain anonymous.      PO Howard Payne  Released 06/08/2018 at 3:19 PM by P.O.
