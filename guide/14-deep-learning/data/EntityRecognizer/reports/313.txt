 Masked thieves took cash from an unlocked safe during an overnight smash-and-grab burglary at Phillips 66, 4 Collins Court. Intruders shattered a glass door to gain access into the store. Witnesses, who were at a nearby park-and-ride lot, told police the two intruders wore masks and gloves and had hoods cinched down over their heads. Released 04/08/2019 at 3:30 PM by PIO Joel Despain
