11 year old male was riding home on his bicycle when he was reportedly approached by the above suspect.  The suspect pulled the vehicle alongside the 11 yr old, opened the door, and told the boy to get in the vehicle, and he would take the boy home and call his parents.  The 11 yr old wisely refused, instead turning and driving off on his bicycle in a direction he felt the vehicle could not follow.  Investigation is continuing.
