He bit one officer, kicked another and spit at several as the MPD took a belligerent and loud 43-year-old man into custody following a disturbance last night inside a State Street bar. While being checked out at a local hospital, the man threatened to kill nurses and others, including the arresting officers.  He was eventually taken to jail on tentative charges that are listed above. Officers were treated for significant exposures due to the spitting and biting. Earlier in the night, the suspect was panhandling and had grabbed a passerby while yelling "I've done worse things in prison than what I'm going to do to you!" The passerby, who was left frightened, had declined to give the suspect money, which prompted the outburst.
