A Madison woman suffered a leg cut, requiring stitches, after an acquaintance threw beer bottles at her during a disturbance on the Starkweather Creek Path (near Hermina St.) yesterday afternoon. The woman walked to a nearby residential area as the suspect tried to pull her - by the hair - away from homes. People heard the commotion, and came outside to investigate causing the suspect to flee. Madison Fire Department paramedics arrived to treat the victim who was later taken to a hospital. She provided the MPD with suspect information and the man was located in the 100 block of State St. around 9:30 p.m. last night. He was arrested on tentative charges which are listed above.
