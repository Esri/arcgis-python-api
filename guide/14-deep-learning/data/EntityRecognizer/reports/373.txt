 A 51-year-old Oregon, WI woman said she was shot at while driving on the West Beltline Highway near Park St. early Sunday morning. The victim told police it appeared the passenger in another car was the one firing rounds. She said the vehicle he was in had been following her after she got in a dispute over money with the passenger. They had initially made contact with one another at a gas station on East Washington Ave. It was not immediately clear what triggered the disagreement over cash. The victim's car did have fresh damage, but she did not know if it was caused by bullets or something else. She was not injured. Released 08/09/2016 at 10:26 AM by PIO Joel Despain
