 The MPD was called to Midvale Elementary School, 502 Caromar Dr., over the noon hour after a man on a bicycle stopped by the playground and appeared to be using a cell phone to capture images of students who were outside for recess. A staff member told the man he needed to leave and he should not be taking photos or recording video of children. The man began yelling and swearing at the staff member. He rode away before police arrived. Officers did not find him and notified other area schools about the incident. The man and his bicycle are described above.
