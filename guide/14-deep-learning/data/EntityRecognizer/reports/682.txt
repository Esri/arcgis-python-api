A 34-year-old male was in his vehicle, positioned at a pump, at the BP Gas Station (4501 Verona Rd) when an unknown subject began shooting towards the gas pumps from the side of the building. Officers were nearby and overheard the gun shots, along with other people that called 911. Bullet casings were located at the BP Gas Station and one round struck the victim's vehicle. No one was injured. The investigation is on-going. Released 05/01/2017 at 11:47 PM by Sgt. Eugene Woehrle
