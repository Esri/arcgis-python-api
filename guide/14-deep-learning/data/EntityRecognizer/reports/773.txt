 The MPD has arrested one of two suspects connected to a drug-related armed robbery that took place in the East Towne Mall parking lot Wednesday afternoon. The victims - a 22-year-old Madison man and a 21-year-old Madison woman - had arranged to sell a small amount of marijuana to an acquaintance. The acquaintance, and a man they did not know, got into their car. The unknown man racked a handgun and pointed it at the victims. He and his accomplice grabbed a backpack containing contraband and fled. Detectives are in the process of trying to identify the gunman. Released 11/08/2018 at 11:55 AM by PIO Joel Despain
