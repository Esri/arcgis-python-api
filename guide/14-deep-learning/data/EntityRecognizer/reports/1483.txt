On June 25, 2018 at about 1:46 am the Dane County Communications Center aired "alert tones" regarding a weapons incident in the 4100 block of Major Avenue. Alert tones are aired immediately prior to dispatch of officers to calls involving weapons or for which there is the potential for serious injury. Officers learned that a 30 year old east side man was awakened to what he described as "pain in his neck". He said he was startled awake to find 28 year old Ryan Bentz with one hand on the victim's throat and the other holding a knife raised up over the victim's face. Reports indicate that the blade was an estimated 6 inches long. The man was able to extricate himself from Bentz' grasp.  The suspect, Bentz, retreated down the stairs as the victim followed. The victim was able to take Bentz to the floor and hold him there while he phoned 911.  Police arrived to find the victim restraining Bentz.  He was taken into custody without further incident. The knife was recovered at the scene. Bentz and the victim were acquainted with each other and this was not a random act. The victim suffered pain in his throat, the likely result of strangulation at Bentz' hands. Bentz was tentatively charged with strangulation, disorderly conduct while armed, burglary and 2nd degree recklessly endangering safety.  He was turned over to the custody of the Dane County jail.  Released 06/25/2018 at 10:40 AM by P.O.
