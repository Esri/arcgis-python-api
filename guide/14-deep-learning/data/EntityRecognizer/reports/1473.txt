 The MPD is looking to identify two people following a wallet snatching last week at Pick 'n Save, 261 Junction Rd. A 70-year-old woman had her wallet lifted from her purse which she had placed in a grocery cart as she shopped. Her stolen credit cards were used to make a number of purchases at West Towne Mall, including $5,000 worth of merchandise at the Apple Store and hundreds of dollars worth of items at Victoria's Secret. Detectives say there have been a number of similar theft cases reported at other Junction Rd. businesses, and at more retail locations around the city. Anyone with information on the people seen in the surveillance photos is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 03/28/2017 at 10:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
