 Three boys were watching television inside a Tree Lane apartment early Saturday morning when they became victims of an armed home invasion. Detectives are trying to determine if two masked men hit the wrong apartment as it did not appear the family that resides in the one they hit has the money the gunmen sought. The victims told responding officers both waived handguns around while ransacking the apartment while looking for cash. The intruders did take some of the family's property. One victim lives in the home and had two friends over while his parents were out. Released 08/28/2017 at 11:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
