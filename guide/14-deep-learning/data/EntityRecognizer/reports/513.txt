On 6/9/2018, Madison police arrived at Kohl's Department Store, and officers had been given specific information about a theft in progress.  Officers set up on the store, and after a suspect had entered a fitting room, with more than $1000.00 of store merchandise, the suspect would soon leave the store with the property; after conducting some interesting sales returns with sales associates of Kohl's. The suspect, later identified as Amanda Elizabeth Meinen, exited the store, and a loss prevention officer attemtped to stop the suspect.  She saw police approaching her, and immediately started to frantically run through the lot.  As an officer continued to give chase (using an audible police siren), the run by Meinen continued down a grassy knoll, but ended a considerable distance away.  Meinen attempted to get into the back door of a nearby store, but the door was locked; effectively ending the race to get away.  Meinen, attempting to catch her breath from running, was ordered to the ground by the responding officers.  When interviewed, Meinen stated that she was not running from police; which seemed strange since she also stated that she had done nothing wrong.  Officers quickly placed her into handcuffs, and she was conveyed to the Dane County Jail on the charge listed.    PO Howard Payne Released 06/15/2018 at 4:12 PM by P.O.
