 The MPD responded to a burglary in progress on La Crescenta Circle last night. A mother of two had locked her family in a bedroom after awakening and realizing an intruder was in their home. She yelled out, and the stranger fled. It was later determined electronics and other items had been stolen. The victim's purse was found outside, having been tossed by a fleeing crook. A neighbor said her dogs began barking at the time of the burglary. She also woke up, looked out, and saw four people getting into a light-colored sedan. The emotional victim told an officer she had forgotten to close her garage door, allowing the criminal(s) access into her car and home. Released 03/03/2016 at 8:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
