He had already shaken hands and introduced himself to a next-door neighbor, and was now in the process of moving his family's belongings into their new abode, when a perplexed realtor drove up. He had sold the home in the popular Monroe St. neighborhood. Only there was one big problem with what he was observing: the man moving his stuff into the house was not the buyer. The new family was not to arrive for a week. The MPD was called to sort things out. An investigating officer approached the proud 25-year-old man who was quite certain he had recently rented the home. He explained how he had used Craigslist to find the property; that a guy named "James" showed it to him; said it was his if he wished. He, and his family, liked the place a lot and gave "James" $3,200: the first month's rent plus a security deposit. "James" and the renter agreed to meet back at the property in a few hours, at which time "James" would provide the house keys. The victim showed up at the appointed rendezvous time, but "James" did not. After waiting, and waiting, the new tenant decided to force open a back door and kick the move in process into high gear. Everything was going swell. He had met his neighbor. The place looked great. And then the realtor arrived. The victim learned the home was never for rent, only for sale. The responding officer told him he had been swindled. The case is under investigation, and "James" has not yet been located. It is not a case of caveat emptor, rather renter beware.      Released 05/19/2016 at 12:30 PM by PIO Joel Despain
