 A fiery rollover crash shut down parts of John Nolen Dr. early Sunday morning. When officers arrived a car was engulfed in flames and upside down on a pedestrian path near Olin Park. It had taken out a light pole and bent back several sections of guardrail on John Nolen Dr. before leaving the roadway on an overpass and landing on the path. An injured and incoherent 24-year-old Madison man was found nearby. He denied being the driver, and was taken to a hospital with what appeared to be non life-threatening injuries. The crash remains under investigation.
