The MPD rolled up on a State Street area battery early this morning as 19-year-old college student was sucker punched by a convicted felon. It appeared the suspect was going to continue to try to deliver more blows to the victim and his friends, but was stopped by officers." I don't know what would have happened had you guys not been there right away," said the victim, who was not seriously injured. He said he had accidently bumped into the man, which caused the suspect to drop his cell phone. The suspect demanded the student give him some money, and then delivered the haymaker, catching the victim completely off guard. The angry man struggled with officers, and was screaming, yelling, and resisting all the way to jail, where he was placed in segregation. Released 05/13/2016 at 10:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
