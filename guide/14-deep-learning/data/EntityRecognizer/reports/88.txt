     It will likely go down as one of the quickest apprehensions of a bank robber in MPD history.     At 12:40 p.m. a call regarding a heist was made from Old National Bank, 2929 N. Sherman Ave. By 12:43, the suspect was on the ground and in handcuffs having just dropped a bag of the bank's money.     When he decided to commit the crime, there were several police officers just a block away as the MPD's North District station is nearby.     As one squad car rolled up on the bank, the suspect took off running. He was taken into custody and is currently at the North District station being questioned by investigators. His name will be released when he is formally arrested.     No weapon was seen during the robbery, but a note was passed.  Released 04/12/2019 at 1:19 PM by PIO Joel Despain
