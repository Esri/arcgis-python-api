  A restaurant employee was extremely shaken and out of breath as she called 911 to report an attack going on last night inside McDonald's, 2402 South Park St.She would later tell responding officers that six teens – all males, one of whom was armed with a handgun - were kicking and punching another young man who was on the floor "balled up to protect himself." At one point, the witness said one teen pulled a gun from a backpack.  He was "straddling" the victim while holding the weapon against the injured teen's body. Suspects fled as 911 was called.     A witness provided the MPD with the license plate and description of their getaway car. It is listed as stolen out of Fitchburg.     The victim says he knows a couple of the suspects but did not want to tell officers any details about the attack. He was not seriously injured.   Released 04/09/2019 at 10:04 AM by PIO Joel Despain
