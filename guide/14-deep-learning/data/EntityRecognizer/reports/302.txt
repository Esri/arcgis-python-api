 A 15-year-old robbery suspect threatened to kill Madison Police officers while resisting arrest inside his Cottage Grove Rd. apartment last evening. A 25-year-old crime victim was able to provide police with clues to the suspect's identity after the two connected over Facebook Marketplace. The victim was selling a gaming console, games and other electronics. The suspect said he wanted to buy them and an arrangement was made to meet in a parking lot near the suspect's home. The victim brought a friend with him. They found the suspect, and he claimed he needed to get a ride to Vernon Ave. so he could get purchase money from someone else. Once at the Vernon Ave. location, the suspect grabbed a bag containing the sale items and ran. The victims gave chase, and at one point the seller's friend got a hold of the bag. The suspect reached for his waistband, intimating he had a gun, while telling the seller's friend: " Drop that s-, or I'm gonna bust a cap in your a!" The victims wisely backed off and contacted the MPD. The suspect was quickly identified via information posted on Facebook Marketplace, and officers went to his apartment to make contact. They advised the victims that – when arranging sales with strangers - it is best to conduct business transactions in safer locations, like MPD district stations.   Released 11/08/2018 at 10:26 AM by PIO Joel Despain
