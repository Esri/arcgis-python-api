The MPD is seeking help in identifying a couple of kitten thieves. An Employee at Noah's Ark Pet Center, 1289 N. Sherman Ave., contacted the MPD Wednesday night after a man and woman made off with a kitten without paying for the pet.  The responding officer was told the man took the kitten while the woman distracted a clerk.  Anyone with information on this case is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.  Released 06/14/2019 at 9:44 AM by P.O.
