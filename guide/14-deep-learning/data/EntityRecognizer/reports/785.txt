 A Madison Police officer ended up in hand-to-hand combat with a suspect who was doing everything he could to disarm the officer yesterday afternoon. The wanted man had two hands on the officer's service weapon - which was secured in its holster - and was pulling on it with so much force, the officer could feel his belt lifting off of his waistline. The two were grappling on the ground after the suspect ran from the officer in the 1100 block of Morraine View Dr. late yesterday afternoon. The officer had recognized Reginald A. Rigsby, age 41, as someone who was wanted on a number of warrants (see above) and tried to make peaceful contact with him. Rigsby lost the foot chase, and when the officer caught up with him Rigsby delivered blows to the officer, and tried to take him to the ground. The officer was able to use counter maneuvers and was the one who took the suspect down. It was while they were wrestling on the ground that the suspect attempted to gain control of the officer's gun. "It was at this point that I realized this could be a deadly force situation and this guy was really attempting to possibly hurt or kill me," wrote the officer in his report on the incident. Backup officers arrived to assist and the suspect was successfully taken into custody. Released 10/27/2017 at 11:25 AM by PIO Joel Despain
