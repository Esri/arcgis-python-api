 Witnesses said a drunken driver nearly hit several cars while careening out of control a couple of times across multiple lanes of traffic on busy Packers Avenue Wednesday morning. The driver's car eventually left the roadway at a high rate of speed and smashed into an apartment building, damaging its brick exterior. Passersby went to the driver's aid and found that he was trying to reverse his course and leave the scene. They prevented him from doing so as first responders arrived. An officer found the driver's eyes to be watery and bloodshot. His speech was slurred and he smelled of alcohol. She asked him if he had been drinking. "All morning," he replied. He was cited for several infractions including third offense drunken driving. Released 03/07/2019 at 10:16 AM by PIO Joel Despain
