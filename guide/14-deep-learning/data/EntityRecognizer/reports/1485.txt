A suspect in an attempted robbery was arrested after the taxi he was traveling in pulled over near Camp Randall Stadium last evening. Police had called the driver to let her know her fare had just tried to holdup a Mobil gas station, 699 S. Whitney Way. The driver knew the man had gotten out to buy some items, but was unaware of criminal wrongdoing. At the gas station, a clerk said the suspect was yelling profanities and making threats while demanding money from the till. The victim said the man got spooked and took off when a customer came inside. The employee explained how the suspect got into a cab. The MPD was able to call its driver. She feigned car trouble and pulled over. Officers arrived shortly thereafter to make the arrest.     Released 07/13/2018 at 11:53 AM by PIO Joel Despain
