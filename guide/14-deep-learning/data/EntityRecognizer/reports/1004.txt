A car was stopped on N. Prospect Ave. near Chadbourne Ave.  Several people got out of the car and started to batter one of the people from their group.  Everyone but the victim then got back into the vehicle.  The vehicle then began to drive away when witnesses heard multiple gunshots.  A shell casing was located at the scene.  No suspects or victims were located and the investigation is still on-going.  Released 12/05/2016 at 5:01 AM by Sgt.
