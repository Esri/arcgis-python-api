     Madison Police K9 Allied led officers to a porch in the 400 block of W. Mifflin St. early this morning. That's where Allied began to bark and pull "extremely strongly." Underneath the porch, lying on his stomach, beneath stairs, a suspect was hiding. He was ordered out and arrested at gunpoint.     Officers had established a perimeter in the area after housemates in the 10 block of N. Broom Street ushered the intruder out of their home. He had come in through a window and entered the bedroom area of a 20-year-old man.     The suspect took off running as police arrived. He might have been hard to find, hiding underneath a porch in the dark, but Allied has a nose for such situations.   Released 04/08/2019 at 9:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
