The MPD and Town of Madison Police teamed up to pull over a stolen car last evening during a high-risk traffic stop on Fish Hatchery Road and Plaenert Dr.  Four local teens were arrested after the MPD got behind the car and a Town officer blocked it from the front, leaving no wiggle room for a getaway. Marijuana was found inside, as were items believed to have been stolen from area stores. Someone had written graffiti on interior doors to include "f- the police." The car's owner also reported fresh damage to the exterior including a broken headlight. The vehicle was stolen Tuesday night from outside the victim's Brandenburg Way home after it was left unlocked with spare keys inside. A laptop computer and other personal items belonging to the owner were now missing. A 14-year-old Fitchburg girl was driving the car at the time police stopped the car. She and her three passengers were taken to the Juvenile Reception Center.  Released 03/21/2019 at 11:14 AM by PIO Joel Despain
