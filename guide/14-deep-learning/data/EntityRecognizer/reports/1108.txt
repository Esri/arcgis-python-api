 A dispute over a State St. panhandling spot results in a 59-year-old man being sent to the hospital with multiple head injuries.  The victim said he was in the prized spot Sunday night, in the 500 block of State St., when the suspect told him to move. A witness told police the suspect punched the victim nearly a dozen times after pushing him up against a wall. The witness said the victim's head was bouncing off of the wall as blows were delivered. The suspect was located and arrested for battery.  Released 03/20/2017 at 11:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
