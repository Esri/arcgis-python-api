 The driver of a pickup was pulled over on N. Stoughton Rd. last night after witnesses saw the truck all over the roadway and running stop signs. A large piece of plywood also flew out of its bed, nearly causing a crash on Highway 30 as a following motorist had to brake hard to avoid hitting it. The suspect left Highway 30 and was stopped just as he began to head south on Stoughton Rd. It was the fifth time he has been arrested for drunken driving.
