 MPD officers warned adults in charge of a group of Indiana teens that they need a solicitor's permit to do door-to-door sales in Madison. A woman who lives in the area of N. High Point Rd. called police Friday afternoon after a couple of teenagers came to her home selling candy. They said they were with "Youth in Action." The homeowner had never heard of the charity and contacted the MPD. Officers located the teen's adult chaperon who was driving a white passenger van with Indiana plates. He was advised of the local ordinance. Another call, with similar concerns about the group, came from a Crestwood Neighborhood resident Saturday night.  Released 04/02/2018 at 9:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
