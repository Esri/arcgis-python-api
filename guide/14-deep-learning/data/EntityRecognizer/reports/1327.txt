Two women, working for a cleaning company, took cover after being shot by BBs Wednesday afternoon. They had just arrived to work at apartments on Morraine View Dr. when they were hit: one in the hand, the other in the leg. As they ducked between parked vehicles, more BBs rained down, taking out a van's window and a car's window. Responding officers, looking at the BBs trajectory determined they must have been shot from one of two balconies of a nearby apartment building. Inside one unit, BBs were found near a balcony door. A 16-year-old resident later pulled a BB gun out from beneath a couch curtain. He said he had been shooting at a fence and accidently hit a car. On Tuesday afternoon, a 44-year-old man was shot in the neck with a BB near the same location of the Wednesday incident. Officers were not immediately able to develop probable cause (PC) to arrest the teen for the Tuesday shooting,  but did have PC to arrest him for what transpired Wednesday.  Released 12/18/2015 at 10:33 AM by PIO Joel Despain
