 Burglary Crime Unit detectives are investigating a smash-and-grab break-in at the UW Credit Union, 1422 Northport Dr. Officers were sent to an alarm just after 3:00 a.m. and discovered a rear glass door had been shattered by a rock. Drawers in the teller area, and in an office, had been pulled open, but an employee - who arrived on scene - did not believe anything had been stolen. A complete inventory would be done by a manager later in the day.   Released 12/07/2017 at 9:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
