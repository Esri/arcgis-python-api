Officers were dispatched to an apartment building on Schroeder Rd. Thursday afternoon after several residents heard a gunshot. Investigators found a bullet struck the front door of the building, but there were no reports of injury or other property damage. One witness saw three young men quickly leaving the building around the time of the incident. They got into a car that sped from a parking lot. Released 01/13/2017 at 11:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
