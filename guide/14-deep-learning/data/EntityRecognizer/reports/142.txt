The MPD arrested a 20-year-old Middleton man after he broke into a family member's home and started a fire by placing clothing on the kitchen stove after turning burners on high. Prior to the arson, the victim had fled her Gammon Lane apartment and gone to a neighbor's to call 911. While she was placing the call, the concerned neighbor went over to the victim's apartment and saw the burning clothing. The neighbor successfully extinguished the flames. There are several adults with disabilities who live in other apartments in the victim's building. None were affected by the small fire. Responding officers determined the suspect also caused significant damage to his relative's apartment: breaking or damaging dishes, glasses, electronics, and other items. He was still on scene when police arrived and taken into custody on tentative charges which are listed above.The victim said she had been having an argument with the suspect prior to the property damage. She had kicked him out, locked the door, and gone to the neighbor's apartment, when he forced entry back into her home.    Released 01/10/2019 at 9:41 AM by PIO Joel Despain
