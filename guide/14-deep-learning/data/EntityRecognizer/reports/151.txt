He had just picked up his three-year-old Wednesday afternoon and secured his daughter in her car seat. But before the Edgerton father could pull out of the lot at La Petite Academy, 6514 Schroeder Rd., both front doors of his Toyota Prius swung open. There was a masked man outside each door, and the one next to the driver's side was pointing a handgun – from one to two feet away - directly at the father's head. He demanded the victim get out of the car. As he did, the gunman ran the 34-year-old dad's pockets, taking his wallet. If there was to be any mercy, it was that the carjackers did allow the victim to safely get his daughter out of her seat before they took off in his Prius. MPD officers swarmed the area, and the car was soon recovered in the 7500 block of Tree Lane. Music was playing, and the front doors were wide open. The robbers were gone, as was the victim's wallet and electronics, including his work laptop computer.  Released 12/06/2018 at 9:57 AM by PIO Joel Despain
