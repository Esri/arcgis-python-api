An Oregon, WI, man's trip to pick up his daughter in downtown Madison became a bit unnerving last evening as an angry and armed man approached the victim while stating, "That's right mother, road rage!" Moments earlier the two men were both driving on N. Park St. when the victim attempted to pull into the lane where the suspect's SUV was traveling. The suspect didn't let the victim in, so the victim sped up and pulled in front of the other driver. The other driver evidently felt he had been cut off, so he followed the victim until Oregon man stopped near his daughter's apartment on W. Lakelawn Place. There, the two men – who were now both outside of their vehicles - exchanged words. The suspect went back to his SUV and retrieved a handgun. After making the "road rage" statement, he drove off leaving the victim scared and disturbed. Released 08/31/2018 at 9:50 AM by PIO Joel Despain
