 The MPD is investigating the deaths of two people found inside a home on Kanazawa Circle this evening. One is an adult male; the other is an adult female. Both died of apparent gun shot wounds. At this time the MPD does not believe there is an ongoing threat to the public because of this incident, and detectives do not think this case is related to other incidents of violence currently being investigated in the greater Madison area. It will be up to the Dane County Medical Examiner to release the names of the deceased as well as the cause and manner of death. Released 05/24/2016 at 9:52 PM by PIO Joel Despain
