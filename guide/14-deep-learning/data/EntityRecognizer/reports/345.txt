 A Madison man was knocked unconscious and suffered facial fractures after being pushed off his bicycle while riding last night in Warner Park, 1625 Northport Dr. The victim told police he had words with a group of teenagers just prior to being injured. The exchange started when the man hit a curb and fell off his bike. He was not hurt, but the teens laughed at him. He told them they were being disrespectful. After that he saw one pull out a small caliber handgun. He told the young man to put the weapon away, and he began to peddle away. That is when, he says, he was chased down and pushed. He was not able to provide detailed descriptions of the teens.  Released 05/23/2019 at 11:51 AM by PIO Joel Despain
