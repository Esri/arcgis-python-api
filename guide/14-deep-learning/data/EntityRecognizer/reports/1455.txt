 Two Madison men were stopped on Interstate 90 Friday night in a car containing more than 98 grams of heroin with a street value estimated at $14,700. The suspects were coming back from Chicago, and the interdiction was the result of a drug investigation orchestrated by the Dane County Narcotics Task Force and the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation. Following the traffic stop, Madison Police SWAT assisted Task Force members in searching the suspects' Worthington Ave. apartment where more evidence - including drug paraphernalia - was seized.
