 The MPD used city surveillance cameras to determine which building a graffiti suspect entered after he spray painted multiple "tags" around the Langdon Street neighborhood. A citizen reported seeing the suspect using green paint to spray the letters "TCK" on a building. Responding officers also noted trash receptacles and other property had been similarly "tagged." Backing up video recorded by a city camera, an officer was able follow the suspect into a Langdon St. apartment building. He was found inside and arrested. Cans of spray paint were confiscated. When asked about his daytime "tagging," the suspect acknowledged feeling "rebellious." He also explained that "TCK" stands for "The Corrupt Kingdom" a club or society he and a buddy founded some time ago that has something to do with role-playing games.
