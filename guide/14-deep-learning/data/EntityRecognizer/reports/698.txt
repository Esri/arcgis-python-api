 Early this morning, an Orfordville mother and her 17-year-old son suffered serious, but non-life-threatening injuries after the car they were traveling in left the roadway and struck a tree in the 2800 block of International Lane. The teen, who was driving, told police he had fallen asleep while at the wheel. Released 11/05/2018 at 2:11 PM by PIO Joel Despain
