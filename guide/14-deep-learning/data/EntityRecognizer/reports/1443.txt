A 19-year-old Fordem Ave. resident was grabbed around the neck and forced to the floor during a home invasion last night. The victim said the masked intruder forced a door open and threatened to shoot him, although he never saw a weapon. The burglar/robber fled with a roommate's safe containing a large amount of cash. The roommate was not home at the time. The apartment appears to have been specifically targeted.  Released 02/03/2016 at 12:22 PM by PIO Joel Despain
