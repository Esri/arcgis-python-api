 A nurse administered lifesaving measures to a driver who was not breathing following a one-car West Beltline crash Thursday afternoon. Other motorists began honking horns after the suspect stopped his car on the ramp from S. Park St. to the West Beltline Highway. Witnesses said he next accelerated quickly, left the roadway, entered a ditch and crashed into a fence. The nurse was driving directly behind the suspect and was among several who went to his aid. She felt for a pulse and found none. Following her training, she pulled the 25-year-old from the driver's seat and onto his side. He began to turn blue and remained unresponsive. That's when she began CPR. Madison Fire paramedics arrived and took over for her. The man was revived, and taken to a hospital. Heroin and drug paraphernalia were found in the crashed car. The suspect was arrested for his fourth offense of operating while under the influence. Released 02/23/2018 at 9:06 AM by PIO Joel Despain
