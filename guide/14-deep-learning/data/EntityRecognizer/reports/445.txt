Downtown officers recognized a man who had just been knocked out early Saturday morning as the same person who had been trying to pick fights in the State Street area earlier in the night. The 42-year-old was found in the 400 block of W. Gilman St. He had a badly swollen eye and was taken to a hospital. He couldn't remember what happened, but a witness said the victim initiated a disturbance with a group of men. There was a fistfight between the victim and one of the men. The witness said a couple of others from the group also got in a few punches and kicks before police arrived. Those involved in the battery have not been identified, but officers are reviewing surveillance video in an attempt to do so. Released 08/20/2018 at 10:37 AM by PIO Joel Despain
