 Overseas scam artists were rude, mean, aggressive and threatening to the point where a 22-year-old Madison woman was overwhelmed and in tears following a fraud attempt last week. She called her father, who assured none of what she was being told was real. The callers, all of whom had Middle Eastern accents, tried to convince the victim they were with the FBI and that she owed money to the IRS. They claimed there was a warrant for her arrest, and that she could face fines of up to $35,000 if she did not get to a store and take out some sort of prepaid card immediately. At one point the victim said she would need to check with local police first before going anywhere. The criminals claimed this was a federal issue and local police would know nothing about it. Now the MPD knows all about yet another attempted fraud and is posting this Incident Report as a continued warning: be wary of any stranger trying to get you to go to a store to take out a prepaid card.
