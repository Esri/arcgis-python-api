Two suspects, both armed with handguns, enter Fazoli's Restaurant.  The suspects point a gun at the manager and order her to the ground.  Another employee is pistol-whipped, but received only minor injuries.  The suspects then flee on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash.  According to a witness, the suspects had a vehicle waiting near the mall (an older model, silver mini-van).  The investigation is on-going.  Released 05/31/2017 at 2:31 AM by Sgt.
