A Madison mother was driving with her 18-year-old daughter on N. Stoughton Rd. Monday morning when a road rage incident culminated with a gun being pointed at her. "He could have shot me," she told an officer. "It was scary!" The victim said the weapon came into play after she gave the finger to the driver of another car, a gray Mazda CX-5. She was upset because he began honking his horn after she was slow to accelerate after a red light turned green. The Mazda had been directly behind her, but pulled up alongside her car. It swerved causing her to pull into another traffic lane. Both stopped for another red light at East Washington Ave., and that's when the other driver pulled out a handgun while screaming something similar to "What's up, b?" The man drove away and the victim pulled over to call 911.  Released 06/11/2019 at 9:10 AM by PIO Joel Despain
