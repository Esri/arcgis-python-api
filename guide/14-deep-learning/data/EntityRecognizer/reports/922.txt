 A North St. resident left her car unlocked and running yesterday afternoon as she ran into her residence for a moment. When she came back outside her car was gone, as was her purse which was inside. The purse contained not only her money and credit cards but her phone. Her car is a tan 2006 Chevy Malibu with a "Drink Wisconsinbly" bumper sticker.
