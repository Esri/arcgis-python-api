The MPD, working with a crime victim and his bank, took a theft suspect into custody Wednesday afternoon after he was lured into a dragnet that had been setup at the Park Bank, 2910 Crossroads Dr. The victim, a 45-year-old Madison man, had his wallet stolen from his pickup truck yesterday morning after he parked it in the 500 block of Atlas Ave. A short time later, a Park Bank employee was calling him letting him know that someone was trying to change the personal identification number on his debit card. The card was frozen, but the suspect – who was calling the bank - was not told this. The banker, working with the MPD, told him he would need to come to a Park Bank ATM to try a new PIN. He said he would come to the Crossroads Dr. branch, and when he did, the MPD was there. The suspect was arrested following a traffic stop. He is currently out on bail for a July armed robbery where a 23-year old man was held up downtown.  He also has an active warrant out of Cook County, Ill.  Released 12/17/2015 at 10:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
