 A Park Ranger for the City of Madison contacted the MPD Sunday after getting a complaint about possible criminal activity taking place at Door Creek Park, 7035 Littlemore Dr. During a check of the parking lot, 20 bullet casings were found. There have been no reports of anyone being shot, or any property damage. A neighbor did remember hearing noises in the night within the past couple of weeks that could have been gunfire.
