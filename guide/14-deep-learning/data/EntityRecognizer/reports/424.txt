 The MPD was called to Home Depot, 4550 Verona Rd., Thursday morning for an employee theft case that store security staff members indicate could amount to more than $14,000 in losses over several months. They said store surveillance cameras showed the suspect repeatedly taking "smart" home products -  like security cameras and thermostats – and concealing them in a backpack. Security told the MPD the suspect then posted stolen merchandise for sale on his Facebook page. He was arrested at the store yesterday on tentative charges listed above.  Released 01/05/2018 at 9:35 AM by PIO Joel Despain
