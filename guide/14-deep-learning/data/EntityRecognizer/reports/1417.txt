On 12/30/2015, at approximately 4:27 am, Madison Police were dispatched to 525 University Avenue reference a burglary alarm from the front door of University Avenue Liquor.  As luck would have it, an officer happened to be at or near the 500 block of Conklin Place, and noticed a male subject near a Chrysler Pacifica.  The male, later identified as Luke Fabrizio, appeared to be shocked to see the officer and immediately started running.  Having the burglary information in mind, this seemed to be too coincidental of an occurrence, and the chase commenced.  The officer continued to track Fabrizio, as he jumped a retaining wall, fell to the ground, and ended up on University Avenue; where he would see a different Madison Police Officer.  The proverbial words "Freeze police" were uttered by an officer, and Fabrizio immediately complied with being handcuffed and detained.  As the investigation would unfold, officers originally thought Fabrizio may have been involved in the burglary at University Avenue Liquor, based on proximity and also due to Fabrizio's reation.  With the assistance of the business owner, video surveillance footage cleared Fabrizio off all wrongdoing related to the burglary.  The bad news is Fabrizio was connected to a simultaneous crime of having entered a vehicle and stolen a pair of glasses; the Chrysler Pacifica near the location he was first sighted.  Fabrizio did state that he realized he could not outrun the squad cars, but if we had summer conditions, it would have been different.  This turned out to be one of the rare instances where winter-like conditions proved to be a positive thing, and Fabrizio was booked into the Dane County Jail.  Alcohol was thought to be a contributing factor in this event. PO Howard Payne        Released 12/30/2015 at 11:14 AM by P.O.
