What was originally called in as a large fight between a group of adolescents, turned out to be more of a one-on-one between two boys.  Yesterday afternoon, they started pushing, shoving and wrestling inside the Meadowridge Branch of the Madison Public Library, 5726 Raymond Rd. When staff members went to intervene, they took the dispute outside where punches were exchanged. Officers arrived to find a group of young people in the area. The two who had been fighting were taken into custody. Released 05/23/2018 at 10:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
