The MPD arrested a 32-year-old Madison woman Thursday evening for assaulting two City of Madison parking ramp attendants. Keisha A. El was pulled over on Swanton Dr. and taken into custody on two counts of battery and two counts of disorderly conduct. She's accused of striking a 22-year-old parking attendant and throwing her to the pavement by the hair.  When a 59-year-old co-worker came to the victim's aid, the suspect is accused of pushing her backwards into a parking attendant booth inside the State Street Campus Garage, 430 N. Frances St. The victims were in the process of recording the suspect's license plate number around 12:30 a.m. after a passenger in the woman's car damaged a parking gate. A surveillance camera captured the confrontations which added to the investigating officers' ability to quickly identify a suspect. She did drive away from the scene, but as aforementioned, was located later in the day. Neither victim was seriously hurt, but the younger woman choked back tears and needed to compose herself while telling police how badly the incident had shaken her.  Released 06/14/2019 at 3:26 PM by PIO Joel Despain
