On 6/15/2017, a 13-year-old female was biking home (in the S. Eau Claire Ave/Regent street area), when a M/W subject with brown hair began to follow her.  No words were spoken by the suspect, but he was operating a dark blue Subaru; a vehicle that was very similar to another like enticement report on 6/9/2017 (See case #2017-902032 for further details).  There were striking similarities to both cases (description of the suspect and his vehicle), and this led officers on a quick canvas of the area; in hopes of locating the suspect.  Unfortunately no one has been identified thus far.  If anyone has any information about such a vehicle, which might fit the description of what has been described above, they are highly encouraged to contact police as soon as possible.  The partial license plate was thought to have the characters of 7, X, T, J, and the public is reminded that there was no particular order recalled by the 13-year-old victim.  It is not definitive that the characters are entirely correct.  It is a good practice to communicate with younger juveniles about never talking with/to people they do not know (strangers), and devise a safety plan that is easy to remember and execute.
