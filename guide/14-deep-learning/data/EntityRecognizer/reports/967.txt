 A double-pane window saved a gas station clerk from being hit by an errant bullet Friday night after a gunman opened fire on a car that had just pulled in near the pumps at CP Mart, 4102 Commercial Ave. The armed man had just purchased gas, and seemed to recognize the dark sedan that had arrived. Witnesses report many rounds being fired and multiple casings were recovered. The shooter sped from the area prior to police arrival as did the car that had been shot at. Officers found the bullet that hit the gas station made it through one pane of glass. There is approximately an inch of space between it and the second pane. The bullet got hung up there. The 48-year-old clerk was standing just three-feet away from where the round hit the window. Released 12/11/2017 at 9:34 AM by PIO Joel Despain
