 The MPD has received numerous calls from community members over the past 24 hours regarding email threats. They all appear to be generally the same. Someone using the name "Stephen Gray" with a Gmail address is sending this poorly written, grammatically incorrect message: "Some one paid me to kill you, If you inform the police or any body, DEATH IS PROMISED GET BACK TO ME for details." The MPD has sent a reply email to the sender's address asking how we can move forward with this fraud case. To date, we have not gotten a response. If you get a similar email threat, please delete. There is nothing to indicate this is anything more than a scam or spam. Released 05/25/2017 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
