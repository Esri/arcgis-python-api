A Madison Police officer used deadly force tonight to stop a burglary suspect who was advancing on the officer while armed with a pitchfork. The suspect had ignored orders to drop the weapon after breaking into a home in the 1300 block of Morrison St.  A neighbor called for police after initially seeing a man in Lake Monona. The witness next observed the suspicous person  break out a window of a nearby house. The homeowners fled as the stranger entered. Dispatch indicated the intruder was inside and believed to be smashing items. The first responding officer planned to set up a permimeter and wait for backup. Before that could happen the suspect emerged from the home carrying a four-pronged pitchfork, what some with lakefront property might use to clear weeds.  The officer ordered the man to drop the weapon, but the man did not. He advanced on the officer at which time the officer used deadly force, shooting the suspect. Investigators from the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation have responded to the scene, and under law will investigate the officer involved shooting.  It will be up to the Dane County Medical Examiner to identify the deceased and determine the cause and manner of death.  Released 07/01/2016 at 12:29 AM by PIO Joel Despain
