Officers responded to the 3000 block of Darbo Dr for a report of people with guns.  Multiple officers responded and a victim was located, who stated he was approached by one male out of a group of 6 as he walked past them.  An arugment ensued, and this male suspect presented a gun.  The altercation then became physical, at which point the other males assisted the first with attacking the victim.  Multiple individuals were reported to have guns, striking the victim and taking the victim's wallet, discarding it a short time later.  Investigation is continuing.
