 The MPD arrested three teens after a parked car and a parked pickup truck were struck by a stolen van at East Towne Mall Monday afternoon. One of the suspects said he and his friends had been "car shopping" in the mall's parking lot, which means they were looking for unlocked vehicles with ignition keys inside. They found a spare key inside a van that was parked near Sears. They jumped in and took off, but did not get far. First the van struck a car. Witnesses next saw the suspects jump out as it continued to roll forward, striking a pickup truck. The suspects fled on foot, but concerned citizens were able to help officers determine their direction of travel, and they were apprehended not far from the crash sites.
