 Burglars made off with two vehicles - one valued at $50,000, the other $8,000 -  after breaking into a service bay at Kayser Ford, 2303 W. Beltline Highway. The MPD was called to the scene yesterday morning after a black 2017 Lincoln MKC and a red 2014 Ford Focus were found to be missing. Both had keys inside at the time they were stolen. It was determined a panel of an overhead door had been kicked in allowing criminals to enter. Released 12/06/2017 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
