"Why don't you get a job like normal people," said a Craig Ave. crime victim after he threw one of two thieves to the ground outside his home early yesterday morning. The angry victim had spotted two young men rummaging around inside his SUV. As he had one on the ground, the other threatened him with a sheathed machete - which it turns out had also just been stolen from an unlocked vehicle. Not wishing to be part of a two-on-one fight, he let his captive go, but continued to follow and scold the suspects as they walked away. He told the machete carrying teen that he was "lucky he didn't get shot or beaten." The victim eventually returned home, and told responding officers he was "bummed out" that young people would be "so dumb." The MPD was able to locate the teen, who had been carrying the machete, a couple of blocks from Craig Ave. He no longer had the weapon, saying he tossed it some bushes. He was carrying a backpack containing lots of stolen items (phone charges, adapters, loose change, etc.), and admitted he and his accomplice – who he declined to identify – had spent the entire night walking lots of neighborhoods between Memorial High School and Craig Ave. looking for unlocked vehicles. The MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit is in the process of trying to identify the second suspect. It has been said before, but worth repeating: the best defense to being victimized by opportunistic thieves and burglars is to lock your doors.. Released 05/08/2018 at 9:32 AM by PIO Joel Despain
