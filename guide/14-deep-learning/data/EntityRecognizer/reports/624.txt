 Many people, including children, were outside last evening in the 1400 block of Trailsway, when a man – who was mumbling loudly - caught the attention of many. He paused as he walked down the street as he made a discernible statement: "Ya'll don't know who you're messing with, I'm from Mil!" Onlookers thought that meant the man was from Milwaukee. He reached into his waistband, pulled out a handgun, and fired it into the air. A couple of teenagers picked up the spent shell casing and turned it over to responding police officers. No suspect was located. Released 09/27/2017 at 9:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
