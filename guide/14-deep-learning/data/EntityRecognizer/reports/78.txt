 A 61-year-old Madison woman, who uses a motorized scooter to get around, was struck by a hit-and-run driver Friday afternoon at the intersection of Park and Regent Streets. A witness said the woman was in a crosswalk and had a walk light to proceed across Park Street. A car was turning right from southbound Park Street onto Regent Street when it knocked the woman off her scooter. It did not stop. She suffered shoulder and neck injuries and was transported to a hospital. A witness got a photo of the car that included the license plate number.  It turned out to be stolen out of Fitchburg. There were three young men inside. The MPD is in the process of trying to identify them. Witnesses said very loud music could be heard coming from the stolen car. The victim was not seriously hurt.  Released 04/23/2019 at 10:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
