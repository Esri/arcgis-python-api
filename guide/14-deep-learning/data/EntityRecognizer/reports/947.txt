On 3/6/2018, shortly after 5:06pm, Madison Police were dispatched to 4198 Nakoosa Trail (Walmart) for two detained subjects; under suspicion of retail theft.  When officers arrived, they immediately contacted Tiffany Kuehl and Katherine Heldt; both of whom readily identified themselves as other people.  When officers did a routine check on the pilfering females, they found that they falsely gave names of other individuals, who had significant legal issues; as one person had probationary connections for child neglect.  The name that Kuehl gave rendered a physical composite that did not correlate with the physical body that was before the officer.  It was quickly determined that both Heldt and Kuehl were guilty of much more than retail theft from the store, and were quickly conveyed to the Dane County Jail.  With the assistance from the Dane County Sheriff's Office, the true identities of Heldt & Kuehl were determined, and additional bail jumping charges were levied against both parties.  This was a good case of not attempting to thwart the efforts of quality police work. PO Howard Payne  Released 03/09/2018 at 9:07 AM by P.O.
