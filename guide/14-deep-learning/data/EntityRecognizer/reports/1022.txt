On 3/23/2016, the Dane County 911 Center dispatched officers to the 500 block of Gately Terrace, reference a disturbance involving a female damaging property on site.  When officers arrived and contacted the 65-year-old resident outside his home, he described the suspect, later identified as Jean O'Neil, as being out of control.  Officers could hear the sounds of glass shattering inside the home, as they made their way through the front of the residence to deal with the matter.  Officers immediately located O'Neil, and she was taken into custody.   Officers found broken lamps and multiple pictures that had been ripped off of the wall, in an unexplained tirade by O'Neil.  They attempted to find out why this all happened, but no explanations seemed to rationalize the actions of O'Neil on any level.  Officers, left with no great alternatives, conveyed O'Neil to the Dane County Jail.  They did advise the complainant to use caution in the future in his coordinated plutonic arrangements, which allowed O'Neil an opportunity to be inside his residence in the first place. PO Howard Payne      Released 03/28/2016 at 11:05 AM by P.O.
