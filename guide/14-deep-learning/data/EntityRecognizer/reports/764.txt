What began as a rear-end, fender-bender collision turned into a chaotic scene on E. Johnson St. as victims and passersby surrounded the car of an intoxicated driver, stopping him from leaving the area as police were being called Saturday night.    A 58-year-old Madison man and his 54-year-old wife were in their 2015 Lexus when the driver of a 1995 Honda Civic ran his car into there's along E. Johnson St. The suspect told the victims they should all pull into a parking lot and exchange information. While this was happening, the Civic driver told the husband and wife to not call the MPD, but the husband insisted. At this point, the suspect tried to drive from the lot. The husband was reaching into the driver's side window, trying to turn the Civic off, while his wife jumped on the hood. The car was moving slowly forward and then backward, and she ended up falling to the ground. She began calling for help. A couple of passersby intervened, encircling the victim's car. Somehow, the Civic still backed through a fence, went partially over a rock wall, and ended up on top of a Jeep which was parked below. Police arrived and the suspect was arrested on tentative charges listed above. The husband told officers his foot was run over while trying to stop the driver. It was okay, but he and his wife went to a hospital, both complaining of back pain.  Released 09/17/2018 at 10:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
