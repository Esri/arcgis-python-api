A 21-year-old downtown resident was knocked unconscious after being attacked outside on W. Gilman St. early this morning. He suffered head injuries and a friend of his was also punched. Witnesses told police there had been some sort of argument between the victims and two other men as they crossed paths near University Ave. The victims were attacked, and their assailants fled as passersby called 911.
