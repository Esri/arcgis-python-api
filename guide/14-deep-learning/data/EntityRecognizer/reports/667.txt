On 01/17/2018 at approximately 8:27 PM, Madison Police and Madison Fire responded to a death investigation in the 800 block of Williamson Street.  A 67-year-old Madison resident was found deceased in his own home. Also located in the same residence was the deceased husband's 67-year-old wife, who was found to be in critical condition and was taken to a local hospital. The Dane County Medical Examiner's Office was also on scene.  MFD also evaluated the scene and determined that a gas leak and a Carbon Monoxide leak had not occurred. Investigators do not believe foul play is involved and likely health related events are the cause.  The investigation continues.
