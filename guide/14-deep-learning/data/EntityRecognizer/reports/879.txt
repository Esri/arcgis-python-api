 "I felt my heart drop to my stomach," a teary-eyed 12-year-old girl told a Madison Police officer Saturday night. She had just been walking in the 1700 block of Northport Dr. when a stranger in a parked car called her over to his location. He told the girl she was pretty and wondered if she would come over to his house. Feeling very scared, she replied, "I'm sorry to cut this short sir, but I'm only 12." She said the look on the man's face changed immediately and he drove away. She ran home and told a parent about the encounter which is when the MPD was called.
