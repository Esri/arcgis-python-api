 An east side resident called for police Friday evening after a stranger began banging on basement windows of her Kalas St. home. The woman said the man also attempted to open her patio door, which was locked. When police arrived the stranger was found nearly unconscious and badly beaten in a nearby driveway. Officers determined he had gotten into an unlocked car that was parked there. Witnesses, who were inside the home where the car was parked, told police he was stealing items, and was confronted by two men who were visiting a tenant. Both denied harming the man, but the MPD developed probable cause to arrest them on tentative charges of being party to a substantial battery. The injured man was taken to a hospital for treatment of significant head injuries. They were not believed to be life-threatening. Released 11/14/2016 at 10:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
