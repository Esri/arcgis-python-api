The victim is coming home and parked his vehicle in his building's parking lot.  As he exited his vehicle, he is punched once in the back of his head.  As he turns, he is punched several more times.  The suspec then grabs the victim's wallet and flees.  The suspect is still at large and the investigation is on-going.  Released 10/31/2017 at 4:22 AM by Sgt.
