Officers were on foot patrol near N. Lake Street, and after rounding the corner of the 600 block of University Avenue, they happened to walk upon a fight.  The fight involved approximately 5-6 people, and a plethora of punches were being thrown.  Officers quickly called for more units to help, and witnessed one victim being violently slammed to the ground before they could get close enough to intervene.  Officers approached one subject, identified as Robert Ragan, and tried to get him from physically advancing on others, but that was met with enough resistance that other measures had to be employed.  Ragan refused to comply with any police directives, but the use of an electronic control device (Taser) brought his antics to an end.  This fight seemed to be over nothing more than a female being verbally disrespected by Ragan, and other males challenging him on what they felt was inappropriate.  Officers transported Ragan to the Dane County Jail on all charges listed, and alcohol was noted as a definite contributor to the behavior describe above. PO Howard Payne  Released 03/22/2016 at 10:34 AM by P.O.
