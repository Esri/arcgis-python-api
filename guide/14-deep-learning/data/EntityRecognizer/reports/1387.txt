A 13-year-old boy punched a stranger in the face Monday night after the child said the man came up from behind as he was walking in the 2200 block of Broadway. The teen said the man responded to being hit by throwing him the ground. The youngster said that's when he bit the man's arm, and ran home. Just prior to the alteration, he said he asked the man "What's up?" He wanted to know why the man was walking behind him. He quoted the man as replying, "Don't worry about it." The child said the adult smelled of alcohol and had a disheveled appearance. He last saw him going to a nearby convenience store. The MPD checked surveillance video but did not see anyone matching the man's description in recorded images.. Released 05/07/2019 at 9:59 AM by PIO Joel Despain
