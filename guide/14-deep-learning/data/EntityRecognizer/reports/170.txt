City Parks employee was plowing snow in the Elver Park parking lot. Some children exited a vehicle in the parking lot. The plow driver did not see the children as he was backing, as a result the truck collided with the children. Both kids, ages 6 and 9, were conveyed by Madison Fire to a local hospital with non life threatening injuries. Released 12/17/2016 at 11:35 AM by Sgt. John Rife
