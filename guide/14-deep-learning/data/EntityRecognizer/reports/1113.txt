 A downtown resident said a man came up behind her and lifted her skirt as she was walking on Spring St. Friday afternoon. The victim said the man said nothing, and ventured off. She observed him for a few moments, and believed he was "watching" and "hunting" for another woman to walk in his direction. The MPD as not received other similar reports at this time.
