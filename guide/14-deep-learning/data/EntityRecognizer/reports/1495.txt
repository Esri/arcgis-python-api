The Dane County Narcotics Task Force arrested two Madison men, seized more than $440,000 worth of drugs, four guns, and more than $20,000 cash, following an investigation into high-level cocaine and marijuana trafficking. Last Tuesday, the Task Force was joined by Fitchburg Police, the DEA (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration), DCI (Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation) and MPD SWAT as surveillance was set up on the suspects' two Madison residences: one in the 6500 block of Tottenham Rd., the other on Brompton Circle. The law enforcement team also put eyes on a Fitchburg apartment, located in the 2900 block of Fish Hatchery Rd. Information had been developed that the residence was a stash house, where drugs were being kept.   Shortly after 6:00 p.m., a search warrant was executed on the Fitchburg apartment after the suspects arrived. They were taken into custody without incident. Some 70 pounds of marijuana, with a street value of $356,000 was recovered. Inside a car - one in which the suspects had traveled to the Fitchburg address - two kilograms of cocaine was found. Task Force leaders placed the street value of the drug at $86,000. More than $20,000 cash was seized from another vehicle connected to the suspects. At the Tottenham Rd. address, four guns were found (two loaded handguns and two long guns) as was a smaller amount of marijuana. The investigation also netted a scale, drug packaging, cell phones, ammunition and other evidence. The U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin is reviewing the cases, and the defendants could be tried in federal court.   Released 01/31/2017 at 11:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
