 The MPD is connecting a distraught 22-year-old man with proper resources after a tense and successful negotiation. It took place near Flower Lane and Gammon Rd. last night. The suspect's girlfriend had called for police, telling a Dane County Public Safety Communications' communicator that he claimed to be armed with a knife and wanted police to shoot him, this after she kicked him out of her nearby apartment. Two officers began a dialogue with the man, keeping their guns holstered so not to unnecessarily escalate the situation. The man refused to remove hands from pockets, and repeatedly told officers he wanted them to shoot him. The officer leading the negotiations told the young man they were not going to do that, that they wanted to help him, and told him how officer involved shootings are harming so many communities around the country. Eventually the man decided to comply with the officers' request. He took his hands out of his pockets. It turned out he had no knife. He was unarmed. The officer asked the man to put himself in the officers' shoes, and to think about how scary a situation this was for police. The suspect has no criminal record, and the officer told him he wanted to make sure he got some long-term help, and was not interested in seeing him charged with a crime, but that he would be citing him for obstructing. "I told (him) that I was here to help him, and if he needed anything – a ride to the hospital, if he was feeling like he wanted to die or hurt himself, or it he just wanted to talk about things that he should call me and I would do whatever I could to help him," said the officer, in his report. Madison Fire Department paramedics were called to check the man out, and the MPD's Mental Health officers have been contacted, so that they can follow-up next. The man was transported to jail so he could post on the citation. Released 08/18/2016 at 10:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
