Officers were dispatched to a report of shots fired in the 3500 East Washington Ave.  As officers were responding, dispatch provided updates that a subject had been shot and ran to a nearby address.  Officers located one victim, whose injuries were not life-threatening. The victim was transported to the hospital by EMS. Officers and detectives are still on the scene and the investigation is on-going.  At this time, we believe that the suspect and the victim are known to each other and do not believe that this was a random incident.
