 Last night, a concerned neighbor notified police about a burglary in progress after seeing lights on inside a nearby house on E. Buckeye Rd. The witness knew the homeowner was away and no one should be inside. Responding officers saw a basement window had been broken. They detected movement inside the home, and they set up a perimeter. Two intruders were inside. Both were arrested. Drawers were found to have been rifled through, and one suspect had stolen items - including jewelry - in her pockets. The other suspect claimed the victim's son had recently given her permission to be in his mother's house. It was later determined the son she mentioned had died many months ago.
