 A smooth-talking caller convinced a Family Dollar employee that he was phoning her from the corporate office Saturday and that he had "concerns and questions" about the N. Sherman Ave. store's supply of gift and other prepaid cards. He identified himself as "Chad Copeland" and provided a corporate badge number. "Copeland" indicated cards from the store were "coming back not valid, and will have to be pulled off the shelf." He seemed to have a good working knowledge of the business, and for two hours had the employee provide him with card and PIN numbers. Before it was over he had information on some 50 pre-paid cards worth $4,685. The employee eventually notified a manager about the matter, and after determining a scam had taken place, the real corporate headquarters was able to cancel a few cards, cutting losses by $570.
