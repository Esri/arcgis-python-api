Shortly after 3:30pm, an officer was heading westbound on the West Beltline Hwy and noticed thick black smoke nearby.  The officer went to 5201 Milward Drive (Odana Hills Park), only to find a playground, and all of its play equipment, fully engulfed in flames!  The Madison Fire Department quickly dispatched units to deal with fire, and responding officers began to canvass the area for suspects.  Witnesses were located, and immediately led police to focus on potential suspects; seen in the area just minutes of the fire starting.  Investigators from both The Madison Police Department & Madison Fire Department got heavily involved in following those investigatory leads, as the search for answers heightened.  Evidence collection at the scene, and witness accounts, led to four individuals, between the ages of 12-13, being implicated in the fire; which damaged playground equipment that was estimated at $100,000.00.  The investigators determined that the motive for the fire was to "Burn school supplies", and the juveniles used lighters to burn their personal items on the playground; a playground with structural materials that were highly flammable!  A Madison Police Department case detective completed the investigation, and has referred charges to the Dane County District Attorney for charges of "Negligent handling of burning materials". It is very fortunate that no one was injured in this case, but parents are reminded to be aware of what dangerous items your children might possess.  Conversations about the perilous potential of fire should always be a topic of discussion with juveniles, when the adverse effects of having something serious to happen can leave someone severely injured or even dead. PO Howard Payne   Released 06/18/2017 at 9:45 AM by P.O.
