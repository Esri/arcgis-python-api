 A student who was up late studying early Saturday morning ended up getting head-butted in the face and the victim of an attempted strong-armed robbery. She had left her apartment and gone to a common laundry area of her Fahrenbrook Court apartment building to do some wash when a stranger approached. He asked for her wallet, and when she told him she did not have one on her, he gave her the head-butt and fled. She suffered facial injuries, but did not wish to go to a hospital. Officers found a building entry door damaged, which likely allowed the would-be robber to gain entry. Released 10/25/2016 at 10:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
