Officers were dispatched to assist a bicyclist that was battered on the bike path.  Officers contacted the victim, who received some facial injuries during the battery, but was not transported to the hospital.  The victim reports riding on the bike path when the four suspects walked across the width of the path.  The suspects made enough room for the victim to pass by and when he rode passed, knocked him to the ground and battered him. With the assistance of some witnesses, officers were able to take Daniel into custody, in the area.  Daniel was charged with battery, an outstanding arrest warrant and bail jumping.  During the investigation, officers were able to locate some items of evidence which may provide some good leads.  The investigation is on-going.   Released 10/25/2016 at 8:49 PM by Lt.
