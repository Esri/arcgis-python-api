 MPD crime analysts are advising people parking in the State St. Campus Ramp, 415 N. Lake St., not to leave valuables in plain view. There have been eight theft cases reported at the garage since April 23rd. Most involve windows being broken in order for property to be stolen. Analysts say targeted vehicles are those where drivers and/or passengers have left items out that are easily seen. This afternoon, they posted fliers at the ramp in an effort to further educate those using the facility.
