The money looked good. It felt good, and so Sunday night the seller cut the deal. The 27-year-old Madison man had placed his red 2002 Mercedes Benz for sale using Facebook Marketplace. He got a message from a perspective buyer and they met on O'Brien Court so the potential purchaser could take the car for a test ride. It went well, and he produced $2,300 in $100 bills to close the deal. The title was signed over. The seller took an Uber home, and all seemed to have gone well. That was until he took the proceeds to buy a motorcycle. That's when he learned the "money" paid to him for the Mercedes was bogus. Upon closer inspection, each bill - on both front and back - contains the word "GECERSIZDIR." This is Turkish for "invalid." A quick Google search produces lots of warnings from other areas of the country where similar counterfeit currency has surfaced. The MPD is in the process of trying to identify the suspect who passed them to the unsuspecting car seller here. In the meantime, the Mercedes has been listed as stolen.
