A gray Pontiac G6 crashed straight into a tree on the 700 bl Mesta Ln after it failed to properly make the left turn from Thompson Dr onto Mesta Ln..  Both airbags deployed and a witness saw another vehicle stop by and pick up two occupants from the Pontiac.  The vehicle had also struck a traffic sign at the roundabout at Lien Rd/Thompson Dr..  Another law enforcement agency took a report of the Pontiac being stolen on December 21 after keys were apparently left in it.  The investigation is continuing.  Released 12/24/2018 at 11:32 AM by Lt.
