 A 14-year-old boy suffered a possible broken leg after he ran into a truck that was towing a trailer early this morning. Witnesses said the child left a crosswalk on Regent St., while trying to cross at Brooks St., and cut into a traffic lane where he ran into the rear driver's side of the truck, which was outbound on Regent St. The boy bounced off of the truck and landed in the street at which time a wheel of the trailer rolled over his leg. He was able to use his arms to pull himself out of the street. The driver of the truck was not cited, and the child was taken to a hospital. He appeared to be trying to get to a bus that was stopped on the other side of Regent St. It was still fairly dark at the time of the accident. Released 10/27/2016 at 2:25 PM by PIO Joel Despain
