 Madison Public Library staff estimated damage at $1,200 Thursday morning after a boisterous man ripped a baby changing table off of the wall inside the men's room at the normally quiet Hawthorne Branch, 2707 E. Washington Ave. Witnesses said the suspect had been stomping his foot, pacing, and singing when he jumped on the changing station, just before tearing it down. He was arrested on the tentative charges listed above. Released 02/09/2018 at 9:18 AM by PIO Joel Despain
