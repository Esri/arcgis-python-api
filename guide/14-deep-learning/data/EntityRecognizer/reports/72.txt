 The MPD is seeking citizen help identifying a woman who broke into at least two women's lockers Wednesday at Capitol Fitness, 15 N. Butler St. In one case, a wallet was stolen, and credit cards contained therein were used to make purchases at a couple of Madison stores. Surveillance images captured at one store are attached to this Incident Report. The MPD is working with the Janesville Police Department as it is believed the same suspect committed similar crimes there in recent days. Anyone with information can contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. MPD detectives are also investigating whether the woman was responsible for thefts at Princeton Club East, 1726 Eagan Rd.
