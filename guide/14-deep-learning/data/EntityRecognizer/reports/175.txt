 MPD officers initiated a high-risk traffic stop on E. Gorham St. this morning after witnesses saw a passenger in a car pointing a handgun at random pedestrians in the area of Northport Dr. and School Rd. A look-alike gun was recovered. Someone had broken off its orange tip, making it look more real. The passenger, a 15-year-old girl, was taken to the Juvenile Reception Center on a tentative charge of disorderly conduct.
