The MPD would like to remind the community about the very real potential dangers of carrying a look-alike gun. Yesterday, the MPD received information that a Madison teen was armed with a handgun. A vehicle in which he was traveling in was stopped for speeding on Nakoma Rd. He initially denied having a gun, but later admitted a "fake" firearm was concealed in the center console. An investigating sergeant discovered this was a BB gun looked just like a 9mm handgun. The orange tip had been removed, according to the sergeant, and the gun appeared to have been spray painted black, making it look even more like a real weapon. Officers must make quick decisions when dealing with firearms, and carrying a look-alike weapon like this one could lead to tragic consequences, depending on how it was being displayed.    Released 01/21/2016 at 12:31 PM by PIO Joel Despain
