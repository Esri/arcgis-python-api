 His cell phone was an iPhone X worth $1,500, so when another teen asked to use it last week, the victim was reluctant. The request was made outside of the Mobil gas station, 4601 Verona Rd. The phone's owner said he would dial the number for the other teen, and then put the phone on speaker, so he could maintain control. However, when he began to make the call, the thief grabbed the iPhone and ran off. Released 01/18/2018 at 10:13 AM by PIO Joel Despain
