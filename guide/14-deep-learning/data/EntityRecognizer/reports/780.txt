 An alert neighbor contacted the MPD Tuesday afternoon after witnessing "porch pirating" taking place at a nearby Waubesa St. home. The caller saw a young man take a package that had just been delivered, and was able to provide a very good description. An officer – who had been provided that description - spotted the suspect walking on N. Marquette St. He was in possession of a brand new cell phone, worth more than $400. It had been in the package that had been stolen from the porch. Released 01/11/2017 at 10:37 AM by PIO Joel Despain
