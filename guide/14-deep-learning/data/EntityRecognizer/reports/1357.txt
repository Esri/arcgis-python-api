  A 72-year-old Madison man has reported being mugged last Thursday night while walking in the 600 block of E. Washington Ave. The victim says someone came up from behind and struck him in the head with an object. He lost consciousness for a short time, and later realized his wallet was missing. He finished his walk home and went to sleep. The next day he sought medical after realizing he needed stitches for a head cut sustained during the attack. Medical staff encouraged him to contact police, which he did.  Released 07/16/2018 at 10:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
