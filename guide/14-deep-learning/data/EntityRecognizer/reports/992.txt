On 12/18/15, at approximately 10:00 pm, a Dane County Deputy had initiated a traffic stop on Aberg Ave near ShopKo Dr.  While in his squad completing paperwork related to the traffic stop, the Deputy's squad was struck by a vehicle operated by Jones.  The Deputy was transported to a local hospital.  Jones was processed as an impaired driver and ultimately arrested for OWI Causing Injury and  Illegally Passing Stopped Emergency Vehicles.  None of the parties involved sustained life threatening injuries. Motorists are reminded: If an emergency or roadside service vehicle is parked or standing on or within 12 feet of a roadway, the operator of a motor vehicle approaching the emergency or roadside service vehicle shall proceed with due regard for all other traffic and shall do either of the following: a) Move the motor vehicle into a lane that is not the lane nearest the parked or standing emergency or roadside service vehicle.  or b)  Slow the motor vehicle, maintaining a safe speed for traffic conditions, and operate the motor vehicle at a reduced speed until completely past the emergency.
