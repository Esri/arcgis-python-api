The 74-year old female resident fell asleep in her living room and woke up to suspect #1 standing over her with what appeared to be a 3' long wooden dowel or stick.  Suspect #2 searched the house for items to steal.  Some money and property were taken and then the suspects left the residence.  The victim was not injured.  The investigation is continuing.
