Responding to neighborhood concerns, the Dane County Narcotics Task Force (DCNTF) launched an investigation earlier this year into two Fish Hatchery Rd. roommates who were believed to be peddling cocaine out of their apartment. DCNTF confirmed suspicions held by area residents: the roommates were selling drugs. Tuesday morning DCNTF served a search warrant on the target apartment. The roommates were arrested without incident. Cocaine base (crack), U.S. currency, cell phones, drug packaging and digital scales were among items seized. Members of the MPD's Gang Unit, SWAT team and South District Community Police Team assisted in the operation as did the Tactical Response Team from the Dane County Sheriff's office.  Released 05/08/2019 at 9:29 AM by PIO Joel Despain
