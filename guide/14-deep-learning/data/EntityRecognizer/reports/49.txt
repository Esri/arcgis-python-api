There were residents sleeping inside two Turbot Drive apartment buildings last night when gun shots rang out. Four bullets hit one building. One bullet hit the other. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries. Multiple citizens called 911, and reported hearing eight to ten reports shortly before midnight. One frightened woman – who lives nearby - saw a man ran out from between two buildings just after shots were fired. He got into a dark colored SUV and sped off before police arrived.   Released 04/25/2017 at 9:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
