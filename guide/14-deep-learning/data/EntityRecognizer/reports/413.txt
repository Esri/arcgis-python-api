 A Pinewood Court resident stopped at home for a brief moment to grab her computer last night. She decided to leave her Jeep Liberty Sport running and unlocked while she ran inside. When she came back out, she saw her Jeep pulling away, with a thief now in the driver's seat. The MPD's campaign to get people to lock their vehicles continues. Released 01/11/2018 at 9:44 AM by PIO Joel Despain
