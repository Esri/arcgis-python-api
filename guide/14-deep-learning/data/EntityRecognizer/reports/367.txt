 A 20-year-old Stoughton woman suffered non life-threatening injuries after being robbed and shoved from a moving car on Carling Dr. last night. The victim had asked an acquaintance for a ride from her home in Stoughton to Madison. When the acquaintance arrived, there were three other men in the car with him. The victim said once they got to Carling Drive, one grabbed her money while another threatened to shoot her: "Get the strap, get the strap," yelled the man. Strap is slang for a gun. The victim did not actually see a firearm. Following the robbery she was pushed out of the car. She held onto a door for several seconds, dragging on the pavement, before letting go and calling for police. She suffered abrasions and was treated by Madison Fire Department paramedics.
