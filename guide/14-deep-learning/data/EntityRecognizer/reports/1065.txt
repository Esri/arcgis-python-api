 A knife-wielding man, who threatened a couple on State St. while yelling racial slurs and vulgarities, was arrested Sunday afternoon. The victims, who are black, said the suspect, who is white, pulled a knife and said he could stab them. The couple had originally been on a bus with suspect, and said he was also yelling and swearing before all got off downtown. Witnesses said angry suspect was also screaming at others, both on the bus and on the street. He smelled of intoxicants and was taken to jail. An arresting officer is asking the court ban him from State Street as he this is not the first time he has caused trouble in the area. Released 11/12/2018 at 10:02 AM by PIO Joel Despain
