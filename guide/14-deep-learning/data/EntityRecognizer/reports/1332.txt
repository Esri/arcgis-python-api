A burglary victim's assistance helped the MPD arrest a suspect after two bicycles were recently stolen from her Ohio Ave. home. She spotted one for sale on Craigslist and contacted the seller under the ruse of being an interested buyer. When she suggested they could meet at the MPD's East District station to close the deal, the seller got a feeling he might actually be communicating with the bike's owner. He texted her back and told her he would put the bike in some bushes along St. Paul Ave. What he didn't know was the victim had already contacted the MPD, and a sergeant was also in the process of trying to purchase the victim's bike. The suspect let the sergeant know the original bike - that had been on Craigslist - was no longer for sale, but he had another. Saturday afternoon, the MPD set up a sting in a N. Fourth St. parking lot after the seller agreed that would be a good place to meet. When he arrived with a bicycle, he was arrested for possessing the Ohio Ave. victim's bike. She did find it in the bushes as he had suggested; however, she is still missing the second bike. The suspect told police he might be able to get that second bike back to the victim, if he did not go to jail. He was told that was not an option. As for the bike he brought to the rendezvous' point, where he met up with the police sergeant, the MPD is still trying to find its owner, and it has not been determined if that bike was stolen. The suspect denied stealing any bikes, saying "people find bikes all the time and sell them." Released 07/30/2018 at 12:40 PM by PIO Joel Despain
