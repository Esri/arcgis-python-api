 A burglar made off with cash, jewelry - including family heirlooms - and a car after entering Welton Dr. home early Saturday morning after a garage door was mistakenly left open. Family members were sleeping when the intruder gained access to their home via an unlocked door between the garage and house. A key to the stolen car had been on a hook in the kitchen.
