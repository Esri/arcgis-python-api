On Monday June 18, 2018, MPD was dispatched to the 2400 block of Fremont Avenue to investigate suspicious activity. An unidentified man initially gained a citizen's attention as he appeared quite overdressed for the extreme hot and humid weather experienced that day. The man was reportedly wearing a sweatshirt with the hood pulled up over his head. The citizen reported that the man seemed to bury an unknown object in the ground. The citizen pointed out the grassy area where this occurred. The investigating officer found that "there was a softball-sized rock that had been placed approximately 6 to 8 inches from the shrubbery and that the mud appeared to have been disturbed."  The officer also "noted a stick approximately 6 to 8 inches placed next to the rock."  Digging into the earth beneath the rock, the officer discovered a pill bottle buried about 5 inches deep in the ground. A plastic wrapped substance was found in the small bottle. The substance is believed to be powdered heroin or fentanyl. The officer speculates that this may have been part of a drug transaction. Imagine the surprise of anyone who might return to retrieve the pill bottle and contents. The officer gave notification of the discovery when he stuck an MPD sticker to the rock.  Released 06/19/2018 at 10:35 AM by P.O. David Dexheimer
