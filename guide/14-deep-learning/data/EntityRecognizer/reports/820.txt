A Madison man suffered a broken leg and other non-life-threatening injuries after being struck by dark colored minivan last night. The victim says he was in a crosswalk and had a walk light he was crossing E. Washington Ave. at the intersection with N. Baldwin St. That's when he was struck. The van took off, and the MPD is hoping video evidence might help identify the hit-and-run driver. Released 10/19/2017 at 8:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
