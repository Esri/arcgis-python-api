A 17-year-old La Follette High School student has been detained by police after bringing a gun to school grounds today. The teen was observed in a class loading bullets into a magazine. The MPD's Education Resource Officer, who is assigned to La Follette, was notified and it was later determined the student had a loaded gun in his car which was parked near the school. The teen is expected to face tentative charges of carrying a concealed weapon and possessing a gun on school grounds when he is arrested. He is currently being questioned by the MPD. The teen made no threats to students or staff and told police he has the gun for protection.  Released 05/11/2016 at 5:18 PM by PIO Joel Despain
