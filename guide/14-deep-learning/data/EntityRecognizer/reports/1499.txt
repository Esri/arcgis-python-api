A brazen conman tells a MPD officer he is part of a multimillion dollar phone scam, and that none of the information he provides to victims can be traced by law enforcement. He went on to boast that "they" (he and his co-conspirators) were not scared and planned to continue to scam others out of their money. The conversation took place Sunday when the officer responded to the home of a Madison victim. While talking with the 69-year-old, "Commander Hook from the Dane County Sheriff's Department Montello Unit" called the victim's phone yet another time. The officer took the phone and "Hook" admitted he was a fraud. He had already convinced the woman to wire $1,500 to a Georgia (U.S.) address after making her believe she would be arrested if she did not post "cash bail." The victim had been told that she had been sent a summons for grand jury duty, and that an arrest warrant went out for her arrest when she failed to appear. "Hook" was trying to bilk the victim out of more cash, when the MPD arrived. Most of these scams are being run overseas or out-of-state, and there is little local law enforcement can do to in terms of going after suspects. What we can do is share information with our federal partners. We can also continue to make sure the public is aware of such activity, as we all need to look out for those who might be vulnerable to similar criminal enterprises. In this case, it was a neighbor who called for police after hearing what had happened. Having done so, the neighbor may have prevented more money from being sent to thieves.  Released 01/23/2017 at 12:44 PM by PIO Joel Despain
