One victim was punched several times in the face, and the other was pushed down, as the two 16-year-old girls were robbed in the 300 block of Parkwood Lane Monday night. The teens said they had gone to the area to purchase marijuana, but the man from whom they were to buy the pot ended up taking their money following the assaults.  Released 01/19/2016 at 10:00 AM by PIO Joel Despain
