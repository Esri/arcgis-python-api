The description of the getaway car was very familiar to Memorial's School Resource Officer (SRO). He believed he had just seen the same vehicle in his school's lot yesterday morning, not long before an email was sent out from Middleton High School's SRO. The Middleton SRO was advising two teens were in a white Buick and one just pointed a handgun at a Middleton student. Memorial's SRO grabbed a screen capture of the Buick he had seen off of his school's surveillance footage. He sent the image to Middleton's SRO. Yep, that was the same car. Memorial's SRO was putting out an attempt to locate over his police radio when the suspects pulled into the nearby Jefferson Middle School lot. Memorial's SRO called for backup and let Middleton know he was about to conduct a traffic stop. Working with Memorial's principal, he was given permission to search the car. Three very real looking BB guns were found inside and two Memorial students were arrested for possession of weapons on school premises. Memorial's SRO talked with the teens about why "reports of guns on school campuses are a very sensitive topic and taken very seriously." There were also reports of car windows being shot out by BBs in the Memorial High School parking lot yesterday morning. The SRO is investigating to see if the arrested teens might be responsible.  Released 05/01/2019 at 9:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
