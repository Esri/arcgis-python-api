On 6/23/2016, shortly after 8:27am, Madison Police and The Wisconsin State Patrol responded to a priority call in the 4400 block of Femrite Drive.  The 911 Center advised all responding officers that a 39-year-old male had been chased into his place of employment by a female, later identified as Emma Findley.  Not only was the male victim chased, but Findley was armed with an 8 1/2 inch serrated blade knife!  Findley elevated the knife, and the victim ran into the building, seeking some safe location from being stabbed.  He communicated that as he was being chased, he finally found a door to lock himself behind until police could arrive.  As some point, Findley also broke the back window of the victim's Ford convertible.  Findley fled out the rear of the building, before police could arrived, and she went to a nearby hotel.  She then created a disturbance at that location by harassing the guests.  Findley made comments to guests, as they would walk by, citing her hatred for Latinos and loudly talked about the sexual exploits of those guests in the lobby; even though she had never met any of the people before.  Officers responded to this secondary location, and eventually recovered the knife that was used in the initial case.   Officers never obtained a coherent statement, that logically explained why all of this occurred, but conveyed Findley to the Dane County Jail on all charges listed. PO Howard Payne  Released 06/27/2016 at 4:13 PM by P.O.
