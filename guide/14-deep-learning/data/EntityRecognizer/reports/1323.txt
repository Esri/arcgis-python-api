A number of people attending a conference at the Brassworks Goodman Community Center, 214 Waubesa St., had items stolen from coat pockets this past Friday. A wallet and several sets of keys were taken from racks, and two victims later discovered their vehicles were also gone. A MPD officer, aware that a number of stolen cars have been recovered from the area of Straubel St. and Wright St. checked that location and found a 2011 Nissan Juke belonging to a conference attendee, a woman from Wheaton, IL. Inside the crossover were items that did not belong to the victim: a handgun and marijuana. The weapon's serial number had been scratched off. A MPD parking enforcement officer found the second stolen vehicle, a 2014 Honda CRV, belonging to a Pewaukee woman, parked and unoccupied at the intersection of Blaine Dr. and Toban Dr. The keys were not inside.  Released 03/20/2019 at 10:20 AM by PIO Joel Despain
