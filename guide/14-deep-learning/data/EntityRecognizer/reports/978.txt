 A Madison man said he was forced to "ditch" his bicycle Friday night as he peddled in the 800 block of East Washington Ave. " I thought it was gonna (expletive) hit me," he told police after an out-of-control van came within two feet of striking the 39-year-old. The victim, and other witnesses, said the driver was speeding when he lost control and began fish-tailing. The van left the roadway, slammed into a light pole and a sign before coming to rest on the sidewalk. The driver and a passenger walked away, but the bicyclist followed them until he could see police had made contact with the man and woman. Meanwhile, back at the crash site, passersby began to clap and cheer after an officer was able to pull at the van's steering wheel and get the horn to stop blaring. It had gotten jammed in the crash and had been continuously sounding in the popular night club and restaurant zone from the time of the collision until the officer remedied the situation.    Released 04/15/2019 at 10:39 AM by PIO Joel Despain
