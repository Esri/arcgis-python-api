The suspect entered the bank and demanded cash. He stated he had a weapon and fled on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash. This robbery  is probably related to the Oregon incident (8/26) and two previous incidents at a west side bank. Anyone with information on this crime is encouraged to call the Madison Police Department or Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 08/27/2016 at 12:47 PM by Lt. Timothy Strassman
