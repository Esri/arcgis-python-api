A brick throwing burglar smashed his way into Rocky's Liquor Store, 4429 Milwaukee St. He then stole cigarettes and alcohol. The crime was called in this morning but took place sometime overnight. The Burglary Crimes Unit will be investigating this break-in as well as a similar burglary that took place, a few miles away, at Packer Liquor Store, 3506 Packers Ave. (see separate Incident Report). It is not known if the crimes are connected, but that is a strong possibility. Released 12/09/2016 at 11:18 AM by PIO Joel Despain
