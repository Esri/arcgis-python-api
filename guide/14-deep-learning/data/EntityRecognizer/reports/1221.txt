A Madison man was arrested early this morning after punching a cab driver on State St. The suspect had just been removed from a bar after bouncers said he made unwelcome overtures to women and tried to pick a fight. Once outside, the suspect continued to yell and swear while sticking up middle fingers of both hands. He directed his words and gestures at both bar staff and responding police officers. While in the midst of these activities, he ran into the street, causing a taxi to stop. He then ran up to the open driver's side window and punched the cabbie. He ran from the scene, and tried to hide, but officers caught him.  Released 07/08/2016 at 11:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
