 There was an armed home invasion on Ridgeway Ave. last night. A 20-year-old woman said a man pushed his way into an apartment she shares with others. She was home alone at the time, and says the intruder pointed a handgun and threatened her. He then looked around various rooms of the apartment. As he did so, she fled the unit. Once in the hallway she spotted two other men - both had bandanas over their faces - who appeared to be acting as lookouts. They and the gunman took off moments later. The early investigation suggests this was a targeted burglary, although it is not certain what - if anything - was stolen. Released 01/27/2017 at 10:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
