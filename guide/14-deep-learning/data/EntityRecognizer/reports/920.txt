MPD officers identified a substantial battery suspect after reviewing surveillance video from a downtown bar where the attack occurred on June 26th. They did not have to look far for the suspect as he was already in the Dane County Jail on an unrelated charge. The victim, a 52-year-old Madison man, said he was inside the Kollege Klub, 529 N. Lake St. when the suspect bumped into his bar stool. Following an exchange of words, the suspect punched the victim in the head, causing a cut to the victim's ear which required stitches.  Released 07/03/2017 at 11:01 AM by PIO Joel Despain
