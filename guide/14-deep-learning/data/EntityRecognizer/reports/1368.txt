 It was in a flower pot outside of a Williamson St. business: a purse full of money. A 36-year-old Sun Prairie woman made the discovery Sunday morning, and knew just what to do. She called police and turned it in, without even counting how much cash the purse contained, although she could see it was a significant amount. An investigating officer found a debit card and other items in the purse, and he is attempting to identify the purse's owner, so it can be returned, currency and all.
