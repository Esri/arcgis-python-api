 A mother and daughter from Cottage Grove were battered in the parking lot of an E. Washington Ave. bar early Sunday morning. The victims said there had been some initial heated words exchanged with others inside Connections. As people poured into the parking lot, punches were thrown with the two women both being hit by several men. The older woman suffered a possible broken nose. Her daughter got a chipped tooth and a cut lip. A witness said there were several disturbances taking place in the parking lot, but all ended when someone fired a handgun into the air. Responding officers recovered a shell casing. Released 04/09/2018 at 10:31 AM by PIO Joel Despain
