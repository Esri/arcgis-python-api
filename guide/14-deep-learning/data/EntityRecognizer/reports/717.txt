 "I felt scared," a 14-year-old girl told MPD officers after a stranger told her he was going to take her to his home and commit sex acts on her. The victim was at the South Transfer Point, 802 W. Badger Rd., yesterday afternoon when the man started talking to her. When police arrived, the 56-year-old denied making contact with the teen, but video surveillance indicated otherwise. The suspect is currently out on bail for an open lewd and lascivious behavior case. He has now been arrested for disorderly conduct, bail jumping and on a probation hold.  Released 04/09/2019 at 10:13 AM by PIO Joel Despain
