On 7/29/18, an officer responded to 113 West Towne Mall (LensCrafters) reference a retail theft of nearly $1,000.00 in designer sunglasses that were stolen.  The store official noted the female suspect was acting strangely, and the suspect was paying close attention to the movements of the sales clerk.  The suspect, later identified as Allison R. Gilles, took her opportunity to quickly leave the store with a host of sunglasses, and when confronted by the store manager, brazenly decided to disregard them altogether. Very specific information was obtained by the manger, and passed along to police for the investigation. On 8/2/18, shortly after 2:25pm, a Columbia County Sheriff Deputy happened to be checking on a vehicle (Near Hwy 51 / Arlington Wisconsin) that had run out of gasoline; a vehicle that was occupied by Allison Gilles.  During his contact, he determined that Gilles was connected to the felony theft case, and alerted the Madison Police Department.  Madison Officers coordinated with The Columbia County Sheriff Department, and the arrest/transport were eventually made.  Gilles was booked into the Dane County Jail on the felony retail theft charge. PO Howard Payne  Released 08/03/2018 at 10:57 AM by P.O.
