 An Irvington Drive homeowner contacted the MPD yesterday after determining a new hole in a bathroom wall was likely caused by a bullet. Originally the caller thought damage to a lower wall could have been caused by a doorstop, but then determined it was likely a projectile that was responsible. The victim lives near a bike path and said someone could have fired a gun from that area. She thought this could have happened Sunday. The woman did not think anyone would target her, and that this was likely a random crime. Released 01/15/2019 at 9:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
