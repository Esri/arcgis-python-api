 Madison Memorial's Educational Resource Officer recovered an airsoft BB gun from the backpack of a 15-year-old student this morning. The teen did not threaten anyone and said he brought the BB gun to school in order to give it to someone else. A tip was received that he had a BB gun on school grounds and that is why the ERO and school staff contacted the student.   Released 04/13/2018 at 10:25 AM by PIO Joel Despain
