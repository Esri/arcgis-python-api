Shortly after 5:11am, Madison Police Officers were dispatched to the area of Lake Street and Langdon Street, reference a shots fired / injured person call on board a commuter charter bus.  Officers contacted a 21-year-old subject, who clearly was in need of medical attention, and was bleeding from an apparent gunshot.  Several other riders on the commuter bus, traveling from Minneapolis Minnesota to Chicago Illinois, described hearing a solo gunshot; with a male subject immediately getting up to go to the rear restroom.  Once the subject exited the bus restroom, the driver made an impassioned plea for him to stay on board, as he believed medical attention was warranted.  The subject disregarded the request, and quickly disembarked. The Madison Fire Department arrived on scene, and immediately conveyed the subject to a local hospital for medical attention.  Officers would determine that the injured individual had a loaded 9mm handgun, in a precarious area of his waistline, and ended up firing the gun; striking sensitive areas between his legs.  Officers were able to locate the suspected handgun in the liquid waste area of the restroom.  Thankfully, no other individuals were injured in this situation, and this matter continues to be investigated.   PO Howard Payne  Released 08/16/2017 at 11:14 AM by P.O.
