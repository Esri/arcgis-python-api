 A homeless man needed staples to close a wound after he was caned in the 100 block of State St. early this morning. The victim said a person he only knows by a street name claimed the victim had stolen some of his alcohol. There was a third man sleeping nearby. He uses a cane to get around. The suspect grabbed it and attacked the victim by swinging the cane at his head. During the attack, the victim called 911. This caused the suspect to take off down State St. He remains at large and will be arrested for substantial battery when located.   Released 03/28/2018 at 9:47 AM by PIO Joel Despain
