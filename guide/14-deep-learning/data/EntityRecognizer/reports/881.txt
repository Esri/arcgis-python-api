 A 35-year-old man from Sparta, WI was in Madison with his family Saturday when decided it time to take a seat and take a break from shopping. He was inside West Towne Mall, and someone was just getting up from a nearby couch. He took the person's place. As he did, he noticed wedged between a couch armrest and the seat cushion, a fully-loaded handgun. He contacted security and security notified a Madison Police officer. Upon reviewing surveillance video, they could see a young man get up from the couch and start walking off with a female friend. They did not go far before the young man becomes frantic as he repeatedly pats his pockets. He then begins to sprint back towards the couch where the Sparta man is now seated. The young man slows as he sees a security guard is ahead of him, and going to the couch to meet with the out-of-town shopper. Thanks to the surveillance video, officers were able to locate the young man, who was still in the mall. He was arrested for a carrying concealed weapon and for trespass as West Towne is posted as a "no weapons zone." As for the gun, someone had tried to scratch the serial number off, but a MPD forensic analyst - using a microscope - was able to make out the numerals. It was determined the weapon was stolen from a car that had been parked in a Stonecreek Dr. apartment building garage on August 14th. Released 09/05/2017 at 10:29 AM by PIO Joel Despain
