 A 42-yar-old Winnebago St. resident was taking out the trash last night when he was nearly struck by a car that came careening across traffic lanes. It jumped the curb, went across a front lawn, before striking an apartment building's front porch and rolling over. The driver was not seriously injured and was found to have a blood alcohol level of .27. He was cited for drunken driving and an unsafe lane deviation. His car was significantly damaged.
