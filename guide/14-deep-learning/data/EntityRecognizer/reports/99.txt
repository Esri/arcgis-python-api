A Madison woman, who an arresting officer recognized as a "prolific shoplifter," was taken into custody again Monday afternoon after carrying a large armload of clothing out of East Towne's JCPenney store. The stolen merchandise was valued at nearly $650 and the suspect had taken it to a van. Inside was a man who has a lifetime ban from East Towne Mall because of past retail thefts. He was given a trespass citation. The officer identified both suspects as people who are part of a group that is known to take large quantities of merchandise without paying.  The female suspect told the officer she planned to sell JCPenney's items to a middleman who in turn facilitates fraudulent returns of merchandise to stores for cash. Loss prevention officers told the MPD they want the woman banned, for life,  from both East Towne and West Towne Malls.  Released 03/19/2019 at 10:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
