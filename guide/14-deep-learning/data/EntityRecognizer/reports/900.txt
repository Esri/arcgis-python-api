 A dispute between homeless people resulted in one suffering hand cuts after another pulled a kitchen knife on State Street Friday night. The injured woman said the suspect had been leaving empty bottles of cough syrup in an area where she and others slept. She says he was told to knock it off and leave or he might jeopardize their ability to stay as they try to keep the spot clean. Witnesses say things escalated with the suspect punching one man before cutting the woman. Another man told police he threw a skateboard at the suspect, knocking him to the ground, as the armed man advanced on him. The injured woman said she tried to use a cell phone to call police, but the suspect broke it. She then ran into a nearby business to call for help. Officers later located and arrested the suspect.
