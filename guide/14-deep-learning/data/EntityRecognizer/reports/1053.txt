 Detectives from the MPD's Burglary Crime Unit arrested a 35-year-old Madison man yesterday after he was identified through surveillance images as the suspect who stole copper and aluminum wire from a Watts Rd. building site on February 10th. Construction crews had installed a surveillance camera following a previous burglary. It did the trick. Images were recorded; the suspect was recognized and taken into custody.
