 The MPD's Burglary Crime Unit is investigating a pair of early morning West District home burglaries - likely committed by the same suspect(s). A homeowner called for police after hearing someone in the kitchen of her Meadow Sweet Dr. home around 1:30 a.m. An intruder had gotten in through an open garage, and then unlocked door to the house. A number of items, including a purse, were stolen. A police dog and officers canvassed the area and found backpacks, credit cards, a school ID, and other items dumped on a bike path near Copper Leaf Trail. Some of the stolen items were connected to the Meadow Sweet Dr. residence, others had been taken from a home on Starr Grass Dr. Officers went to that address and awoke the family in that home. They did not realize they had been victimized, but soon discovered someone had come in through an unlocked patio door and stolen several backpacks: one contained a laptop computer. The MPD continues to urge everyone to make sure cars and homes are secured at all times as we continue to deal with very opportunistic criminals.  Released 11/02/2018 at 9:14 AM by PIO Joel Despain
