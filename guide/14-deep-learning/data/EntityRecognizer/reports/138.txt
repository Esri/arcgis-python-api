She didn't figure she needed to pay to lock the locker. After all, she was only placing her old coat in it, and the garment wasn't worth much. The victim, a 71-year-old Madison woman, had come to East Towne Mall yesterday morning to walk with her sister. She now believes when she went to place her coat in a locker, she was actually being watched. That's because when she went to retrieve the jacket, it was missing, and that's not all. When she went to find her car, it was no longer in the lot. She thought she had placed the keys in her pants, but now realized they must have been in the coat. Now it was gone. Her car was gone, and her purse was gone. It had been locked inside the car. Within a couple of hours someone was trying to use her credit cards. A passerby later found the purse dumped on Rusk St., but the victim's money, credit cards and other items were no longer inside. The investigating officer is reviewing surveillance images with hope of identifying suspects. There have now been a dozen vehicles stolen in Madison so far this month.
