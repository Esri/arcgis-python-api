 The MPD chased down and apprehended a teenage burglary suspect following a smash-and-grab style break-in early this morning at the AT&T store, 406 S. Gammon Rd. Multiple officers were responding to an alarm when the suspect was spotted running from the scene. He jumped and fence and crossed the W. Beltline Highway before being taken into custody. He was carrying a bag containing a knife, a weapon he says he uses for protection. The 15-year-old gave police a fake name. He was taken to the Juvenile Reception Center on tentative charges of burglary and obstructing. Released 01/03/2017 at 10:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
