 A woman walking in the 1200 block of Williamson St. early Wednesday morning became the victim of a strong armed robbery. The victim said a man walked up beside her and initially engaged her in cordial conversation. The victim said she pulled her keys from her pocket as she approached her destination. Her wallet was attached to the key ring. It was at that point the stranger grabbed them from her and ran off. Released 12/02/2016 at 11:36 AM by PIO Joel Despain
