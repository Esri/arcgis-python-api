Two males dressed in black with masks entered the PDQ store on Mineral Point Rd around 12:45am demanding that the clerk "hurry up, open the drawer". After seizing some money from the registers, they fled out of the store. A handgun is believed to have been used/threatened in the commission of this crime. A K9 team from Maple Bluff assisted in a track. Suspects are at large. Released 01/05/2017 at 3:29 AM by Sgt.
