 An Appleton woman, visiting Madison, reported being grabbed by a stranger while walking in the 100 block of W. Gilman St. early this morning. The victim said a man with short dark hair struck her with an open hand and attempted to pull her towards some bushes. She was able getaway, and does not know if the man was traveling strictly on foot or if he had gotten out of a car. She dropped her phone and lost a sandal during the attack. Both are still missing.
