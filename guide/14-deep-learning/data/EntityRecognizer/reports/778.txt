A Salvation Army bell ringer left his post at Woodman's Market, 725 S. Gammon Rd., and took off with the donation kettle Tuesday afternoon. The MPD made contact with the man at the West Transfer Point and officers took the kettle back. The suspect claimed he was taking it to the Salvation Army, but an employee for the charitable organization said protocol would be for the kettle to stay at the ringer's location, which in this case would be Woodman's. In addition, the employee said the bell ringer should not have been able to sign out the kettle as he had just been fired for failure to show up on time. Surveillance video showed the suspect not only leaving with the kettle, but pocketing some of the money earmarked for it while he was ringing the bell. He was arrested for theft.  Released 12/05/2018 at 10:15 AM by PIO Joel Despain
