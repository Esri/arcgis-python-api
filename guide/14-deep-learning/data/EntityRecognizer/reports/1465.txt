 A 21-year-old downtown resident reported being grabbed and groped early Saturday morning as she walked through Edward Klief Park, 1200 Milton St. She said a stranger approached from behind, grabbed her arm with one hand while touching her in the genital area - over her clothing - with the other. She pulled away and ran home. Released 05/07/2018 at 11:59 AM by PIO Joel Despain
