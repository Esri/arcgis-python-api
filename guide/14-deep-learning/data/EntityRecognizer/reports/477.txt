Trever R McKeown, a 28 year old Arena, Wisconsin man was tentatively charged with one count of strong armed robbery after a Sunday afternoon incident at the BP gas station at 699 South Gammon Road. McKeown reportedly snatched cash from the hand of a customer at the gas station. The victim alerted her companion to the theft.  The companion then gave chase across the parking lot. While trying to escape, McKeown attempted to enter an occupied van in the Woodman's Grocery lot but was not allowed in by the driver.  McKeown then tried, and was successful in entering the passenger seat of another occupied vehicle.  The driver of that vehicle turned off the car, took the keys and exited.  The victim's companion was able to catch up to the suspect at that point. After a brief scuffle, the victim's companion recovered the stolen currency. No injuries were reported. McKeown was transported to the Dane County Jail. Released 06/18/2018 at 9:44 AM by P.O.
