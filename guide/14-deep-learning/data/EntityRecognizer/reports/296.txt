 A frightened young mother used pepper spray to ward off a burglar during an attempted daytime break-in on W. Doty St. Saturday afternoon. The victim was bathing her child when she heard a noise at a window. Now holding her baby daughter, she went to investigate, and discovered a man outside attempting to remove her screen. She yelled and grabbed her pepper spray. Through the open window, she deployed it, spraying the man in the face. He fled. She next took her infant to the bathroom, locked the door, and called 911. She told responding officers that the would-be intruder was "wild-looking ... looks exactly like Charles Manson." She provided a very detailed description. Officers were able to confirm the suspect's identity. He was located in the 400 block of N. Frances St. and arrested. The man has a lengthy criminal history.    Released 06/26/2017 at 11:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
