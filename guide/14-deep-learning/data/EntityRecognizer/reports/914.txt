 A $72,000 car, stolen in December from a Madison dealership, was recovered by San Francisco Police officers yesterday as a suspect was taken into custody. The yellow 2017 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat disappeared from a Russ Darrow lot, 3502 Lancaster Dr., on the night of December 15th. The MPD put information on the theft out nationwide. The arrested man uses many aliases and dates of birth, so it is not known if the name listed on this Incident Report represents his true identity. It appears he once had a Minneapolis address, and there is an arrest warrant for him out of Missouri. Released 01/10/2017 at 12:37 PM by PIO Joel Despain
