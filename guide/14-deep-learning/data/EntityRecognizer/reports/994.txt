A Williamson St. resident called for police yesterday afternoon when she spotted what she thought to be a gun in an area behind her home and near the Capital City Trail. An officer came to check it out, and yes, it was not only a gun, but an AR-15 rifle with a scope. It had been under some snow and leaves and appeared to have been in the location for some time. The witness said city crews recently cleared some brush from the area, which could be why the gun was not observed earlier. The investigating officer determined the weapon had been stolen from a car last September. It had been parked on Union St. and its owner had accidently left a window partially open. The theft was one of the cases that prompted the MPD to launch its #NightlyLockup campaign. Released 02/01/2018 at 10:19 AM by PIO Joel Despain
