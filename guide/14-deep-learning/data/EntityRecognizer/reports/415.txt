 A Madison father of four contacted the MPD's Self Report Unit yesterday after his family and friends started contacting him about some shocking news. Shocking, at least, had it been true. "Last night I was called by me four kids and many friends stating that I had sent them an email asking for money for I was held hostage somewhere in California," the 71-year-old related. There was a major problem: "I was not in California yesterday." And, he knew of no one asking for ransom on his behalf. He concluded his email must have been hacked. He tried to open it, and his thoughts were confirmed. It would not open. "My email address had been stolen by somebody. I could not believe it," he said in disbelief. "I have heard other people complaining that their emails were hacked. I did not know it could happen to me." He worked with his service provider to set up a new password and security settings, and he made sure his bank accounts were secure. "So this thing they call email hacking is real," he told the Self Report Unit. "I wasted the whole day just to ensure I could use my computer again." He also filed a complaint with Wisconsin's Consumer Protection Hotline. Released 11/17/2016 at 11:15 AM by PIO Joel Despain
