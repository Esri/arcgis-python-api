 A 21-year-old downtown resident needed multiple staples to close head and shoulder cuts after being pushed into a window in the 600 block of University Ave. early Monday morning. The victim did not contact the MPD until Tuesday to report the injuries. He told police he had made a remark about a woman's weight while in a bar just prior to the incident. After he left, he said a male friend of the woman pushed him, sending him into the window, breaking the glass. At the time of the occurrence, the MPD was called to a disturbance. Officers found the damaged window, but did not locate a victim or suspects, as all had left the area. The victim said he went to his parents' Milwaukee area home to seek medical attention.
