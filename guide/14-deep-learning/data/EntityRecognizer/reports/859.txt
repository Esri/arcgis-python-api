 A Madison man suffered significant head injuries after apparently falling from a second floor Webb Ave. apartment building balcony Saturday night. Friends said the victim had been drinking. No one actually saw him fall, but said he was along on the balcony at the time of the mishap. When the first officer arrived the 54-year-old was on the ground, in a pool of blood, gasping and having very labored, irregular breathing. He was transported to a hospital by Madison Fire Department paramedics. Doctors said he would survive.  Released 05/31/2016 at 3:07 PM by PIO Joel Despain
