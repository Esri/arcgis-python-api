 Members of the Dane County Narcotics Task Force called for Dane County Human Services to come to the scene of a drug investigation last week after finding a five-year-old child living in deplorable conditions inside a Wintergreen Dr. home. It was littered with needles (some 100 found in various rooms) and other drug paraphernalia. During a search of the house, Task Force members also recovered ecstasy, marijuana, a shotgun and ammunition. A 33-year-old woman was arrested for maintaining a drug dwelling. Agents also determined she recently used a 94-year-old relative in an attempt to have MDMA (ecstasy) delivered to a Dane County Jail inmate. The drugs were found inside a pair of shoes. The suspect had given them to the relative so they could be delivered to the inmate. The courier did not know about the contraband. The child has been removed from the home and placed in a safe setting.   Released 10/03/2016 at 12:40 PM by PIO Joel Despain
