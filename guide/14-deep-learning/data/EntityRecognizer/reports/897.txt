 A robber had no luck getting any cash this morning after trying to holdup Klinke Cleaners, 939 S. Park St. He showed no weapon, but demanded money. An employee told him no, and he fled. The victim said the guy appeared to be "strung out." Detectives believe this case could be connected to another failed robbery that took place at a nearby Subway Wednesday morning.  Released 01/05/2018 at 9:52 AM by PIO Joel Despain
