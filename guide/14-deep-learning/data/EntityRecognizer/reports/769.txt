Numerous headstones at Madison's historic Forest Hill Cemetery were damaged overnight. An employee notified the MPD this morning after discovering the vandalism. He found 36 headstones tipped over, with about a dozen suffering significant damage: either cracked or shattered. The Jewish area of the cemetery, and the section where Confederate soldiers are buried were both checked, and neither was disturbed. At this point it appears monuments and grave markers were randomly toppled. Anyone with information on the crimes is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.
