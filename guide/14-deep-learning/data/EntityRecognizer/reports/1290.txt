 A 16-year-old girl attempted to disarm a Madison Police sergeant Saturday afternoon after several officers responded to a disturbance taking place outside in the 1100 block of Morraine View Dr. The suspect had just used pepper spray on some involved in a dispute that originally involved several teenagers. The suspect struggled with officers, trying to grab the service weapon, and also attempting to spit on officers. A 38-year-old man, who was hit with the pepper spray, armed himself with a knife during the altercation. He said he did so in self-defense. He was arrested for disorderly conduct while armed. Officers said the scene was initially tense and chaotic.  Released 08/13/2018 at 10:58 AM by PIO Joel Despain
