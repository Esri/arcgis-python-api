MPD officers are at the scene of a weapons offense with shots fired in the area of Rieder Rd and Portage Rd. At least one house has sustained bullet strike damage and officers are still accessing and securing the area at this time (18:07). More information will be forthcoming as it becomes available tonight. As of 19:00, we have three confirmed residences, two of which were occupied by residents, that were struck by bullets, but thankfully, no residents or bystanders were struck by the rounds as far as law enforcement knows at this time. Numerous casings of two different calibers were located at the scene and officers, detectives, and investigators are currently working to attempt to identify the individuals involved in this incident and to process the scene. As of 21:18, detectives are working on locating and interviewing two persons of interest involved in tonight's weapons offense. These two individuals are known to each other and it does not appear that tonight's incident was a random act of violence. Released 06/13/2018 at 6:12 PM by Lt. Mindy Winter
