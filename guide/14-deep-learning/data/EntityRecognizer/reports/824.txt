Reed crashed his vehicle into a traffic signal at the intersection of E Wash/N Ingersoll and drove away.  The two left tires of his vehicle were destroyed so it was riding on its rims, and also had significant left side damage.  Reed drove the vehicle to Darwin Dr on the North side where it was found with him in it.  Reed denied being involved in a crash, although debris found at the crash scene matched his vehicle.  He was arrested for 5th offense OMVWI and other charges.
