 A Madison grandmother wired $3,700 to scam artists after being convinced her grandson had been in a traffic crash with a pregnant woman and that she might lose her unborn child. The 82-year-old got the call from her "grandson" late last month. He told her he was in the Chicago area and needed bail money, without delay, to stay out of jail. He provided her with the phone number of his "public defender." The victim called it and was told how to wire funds to an address in New Jersey. After doing so, the "public defender" called her again saying the "judge" had raised bail by $1,000 because he had lost a daughter to a drunken driver. The grandmother wired no more cash and instead told the man to contact her grandson's parents. She also let them – her son and daughter-in-law - know what had happened, and they told the MPD about the fraud.  Released 10/03/2017 at 2:37 PM by PIO Joel Despain
