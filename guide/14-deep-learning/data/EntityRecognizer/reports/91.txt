 A 16-year-old girl was parked near her Blaine Dr. home Friday night, having just gotten off of work, when two young men approached her car and tried to open the passenger side door. It was locked. Moments later, the victim said the teens got into a car. As it drove past, one passenger held up a handgun. About this time, her father came out of the house and police were called.  Released 01/17/2017 at 10:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
