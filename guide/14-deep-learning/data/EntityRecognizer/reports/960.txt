West District commanders are praising officers for not getting baited into a serious confrontation with a masked man earlier this week. He showed up outside of Walmart, 7202 Watts Rd., just before 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning. Employees saw him and called 911 fearing they were about to be robbed. Realizing he had been spotted, the suspect popped open an umbrella to further shield his face as he began to walk away. He was wearing a ski mask under the hood of a sweatshirt. An officer spotted him at the intersection of Odana Rd. and Gammon Rd. and wanted to check on his welfare. The suspect refused commands to stop, and instead shined a flashlight in the officer's face. The officer could tell the suspect had something in his other hand, and the he was refusing to keep his hands out of his pockets. "I did believe that I was imminent danger of either death of bodily harm. His behavior was very random, very unpredictable and very uncooperative. I did not know what his intentions were and was afraid for my safety without a doubt," said the officer in his report. He felt the suspect was purposely trying to evoke some sort of physical police response. The officer, and others arriving chose to create more distance with the suspect while continuing to yell out commands: "Stop!" "Stay where you are!" "Take your hands out of your pockets!" The suspect eventually did stop. He was identified as a registered sex offender out of Platteville. He was arrested - without any use of force - for disorderly conduct and resisting/obstructing a police officer.  West District Captain Cory Nelson said the officers did a "phenomenal job" of peacefully deescalating a tense situation through patience and sound tactics.  Released 05/04/2018 at 12:05 PM by PIO Joel Despain
