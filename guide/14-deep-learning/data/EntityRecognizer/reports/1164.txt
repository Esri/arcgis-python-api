 A Madison teen was taken into custody after pointing a BB gun at middle school students who were riding on a Madison Metro bus Tuesday afternoon. Students reported the incident to their parents and the MPD was notified. Officers made contact with the 13-year-old at his residence. He acknowledged having a BB gun, but said he threw it in the Yahara River on his way home. Some who saw the gun did not know it was a fake and were shocked and scared when it was pointed at the bus. The arrested teen was outside the bus, on a sidewalk, when the incident occurred.
