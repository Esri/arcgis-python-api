A Middleton woman was attacked Monday inside the Madison Public Library while seated at a computer. A 36-year-old Stoughton man, who is dealing with mental health issues, twice knocked the victim's hat off her head before punching her a couple of times. She ended up falling out of her chair, and used pepper spray against the man in an attempt to get him to stop. He left the library but was contacted by MPD a short time later. A MPD Mental Health Liaison Officer assisted with working to get the man to a secure facility where he can get help. The victim was not injured.   Released 03/06/2018 at 10:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
