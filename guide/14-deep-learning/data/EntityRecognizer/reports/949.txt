On June 5th, 2018, shortly after 423pm, Madison Police Officers responded to the 1400 block of Emil Street reference a disturbance involving a handgun.  Police started interviewing witnesses that saw a 16-year-old black male, display a handgun in his waistband, and possibly riding in a stolen Acura sedan (black).  The 16-year-old male had an issue with another 16-year-old male, and the altercation seemed to be largely related to information that was strewn over social media platforms.  When officers arrived, the suspect(s) had left the scene, but good information was developed to determine many of the involved parties; involved in this particular altercation.  Only probable cause existed to arrest the 16-year-old 'on two counts of disorderly conduct while armed' at this stage of the investigation.  A search commenced,but was called off after the teen was not located. On June 9th, around 4:00pm, a very astute Madison Police Officer heard The Fitchburg Police Department being dispatched to a residence in the 1900 block of Pike Drive, and noted that there was a person on scene with a warrant.  This officer, who was definitely familiar with the location and individuals wanted in that area, communicated this information to The Fitchburg Police Department, and they were able to take the 16-year-old male subject into custody.  It should be noted that this juvenile has also been connected to a battery case on 5/29/2018 as well!  The juvenile was confined at The Juvenile Reception Center on a variety of charges.  All of these cases continue to be investigated.     PO Howard Payne   Released 06/11/2018 at 4:08 PM by P.O.
