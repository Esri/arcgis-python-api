 Thieves stole seven individual air conditioning units – each valued at around $2,500 -from an E. Washington Ave. apartment complex. The MPD learned of the loss when contacted by a management company employee Wednesday morning. He said this was the third crime spree in the past couple of weeks involving the property's air conditioners. First someone cut copper coils from two. The next day, two were stolen. Now, seven more are missing. A witness reported seeing a couple of men near targeted AC units around 7:00 a.m. yesterday morning. They may have been operating a dark colored pickup truck. Anyone with information is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.    Released 01/05/2017 at 11:47 AM by PIO Joel Despain
