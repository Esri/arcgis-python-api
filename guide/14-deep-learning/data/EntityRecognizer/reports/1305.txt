 A Madison woman was able to escape, in her stocking feet, out of her School Rd. apartment last night after she was shot at, battered and strangled by an ex-boyfriend. The victim said the suspect made statements suggesting that if he could not have her, no one could. She believes she suffered a shrapnel wound to a finger after a shot was fired. With the weapon still pointed at her, she charged the gunman and they grappled for control of the handgun. She was eventually able to push him down, and flee out the door, down the road, and into another apartment building where she called for help. Meanwhile, the suspect drove off. The MPD developed information he might head to Milwaukee. Milwaukee Police were notified and provided details. That department's officers were able to take the suspect into custody and recover the gun. Madison detectives then traveled to Milwaukee and brought him back to Dane County. The victim suffered several non-life-threatening injuries. Released 01/03/2018 at 10:25 AM by PIO Joel Despain
