 A masked man with gun robbed a pizza delivery driver on Waunona Woods Court last night. The victim said she attempted to deliver a pie, but residents inside an apartment - the address to where she had been dispatched - said she they had not ordered a pizza. The victim returned to her car where she was confronted by the gunman. He demanded pizza and money. She gave him food, but said her wallet was inside the car. As she went into it, instead following his demands, she hit the horn. This caused the robber to flee with pizza, but no cash. Released 11/23/2016 at 11:17 AM by PIO Joel Despain
