 A UW-Madison fraternity member tackled and held down one of three suspects after he and his girlfriend arrived at his Langdon St. residence last night to find a burglary in progress. The frightened and distraught girlfriend removed a knife that was clipped to the suspect's belt of pocket, fearing he might harm her boyfriend. Several officers responded to the call, taking the suspect into custody and systematically clearing the four-level fraternity house to make sure no others were still present. Thanks to the work of the 20-year-old fraternity member the 16-year-old suspect was taken to the Juvenile Reception Center on multiple tentative charges. Officers found he had been in possession of five knives, a lock picking set, a fake driver's license, and several items – including a debit card – that had likely been stolen. Most items were in his backpack. The teen's co-conspirators fled prior to the MPD's arrival. Released 08/09/2016 at 9:27 AM by PIO Joel Despain
