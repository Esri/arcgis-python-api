 A 25-year-old homeless man was arrested early this morning inside a Wisconsin Ave. parking garage after he threatened to slit the throats of two other homeless people with the jagged edge of a broken bottle. The victims had taken shelter in the structure due to a deluge of rain. The suspect, who previously had a relationship with the female victim, showed up and became angry to see her with another man. That's when he lunged and slashed at them with the broken bottle. "You're going to die," he yelled at the couple. She fled to call police, prompting the suspect to also leave the area. Officers found him nearby and took him into custody. Released 05/14/2018 at 3:20 PM by PIO Joel Despain
