On 6/13/2017, The North District Community Policing Team (NCPT) was involved in a drug interdiction project near the 4700 block of Hayes road. A variety of tip(s) information had been divulged to the NCPT, reference past suspected drug activity in the area, and this led to the team setting up a surveillance operation.  Officers monitored the area, and shortly after 5pm, noticed a 2000 Buick LeSabre driving into a hotel parking lot.  The movements, of both the car and all occupants of the lurking vehicle, did not seem to fit with normal patron activities, and the car was stopped a short distance away. After a number of interviews, of all involved parties in the vehicle were conducted, officers were able to determine that drug involvement was the likely reason behind why this particular vehicle was in the area; and correlated to information that NCPT had developed.  More than 100 grams of Marijuana, scales, and drug packaging materials were recovered, and David C. Dodge was then taken to The Dane County Jail on related charges.  Officers were conducting this operation to improve the quality of life for both residents and business patrons of the area, and hopefully this leads to an overall reduction in like activities of this nature.
