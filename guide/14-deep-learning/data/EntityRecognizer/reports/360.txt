A smash-and-grab burglar hit a PDQ on W. Broadway last week bringing to eight the number of December business break-ins where quantities of tobacco products – mostly cigarettes - have been stolen from Dane County convenience stores. Madison Police crime analysts place the value of stolen merchandise at approximately $40,000. There have been two men seen in surveillance images.  One is a black male, 5'10" to 6', with a stocky build. Photographs of this person are posted with this report. The second burglar has been described as a man with an average build. It is believed most, if not all, of these crimes are connected.  Anyone with information is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014.  Released 01/05/2016 at 11:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
