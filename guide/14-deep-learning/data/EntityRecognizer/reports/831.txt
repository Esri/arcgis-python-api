 A Fond du Lac, in Madison with friends to attend a show, was not seriously injured when he fell several floors from the outside of Monona Terrace, 1 E. Wilson St. The group was using Google Maps to find their way back to their hotel from a bar on Williamson St. This took them along Lake Monona, to a Monona Terrace elevator. They got off on the top level of the parking structure. As they began to walk towards the Hilton Hotel, the victim decided to jump over a cement barrier. He placed both hands on it, went over and thought he would land on a surface at the same level. Instead, he fell several stories to the railroad tracks below. He was transported to a hospital with a badly broken arm, but no other injuries were identified by medical staff members. Released 01/11/2018 at 10:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
