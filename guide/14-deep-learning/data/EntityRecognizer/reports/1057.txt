 A burglar used a crowbar to damage donation boxes and booths that are part of the Holiday Fantasy in Lights display at Turville Point Conservation Park, 1155 Olin-Turville Court. Money is removed from the boxes nightly and is not believed the thief made off with much, if any, cash. However, damage to nearby booths and surveillance cameras is estimated at $1,500. The criminal activity was discovered this morning. Released 12/28/2017 at 1:23 PM by PIO Joel Despain
