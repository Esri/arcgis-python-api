 West High's Educational Resource Officer suffered a broken bone in his hand while breaking up several disturbances inside the school Monday morning. Numerous officers were called to West to back up the ERO as the MPD worked with school staff members to restore decorum following loud outbursts and disruptive behavior. Following one incident, three girls were arrested for fighting. During the dispute, a school official was inadvertently punched by one of the girls while helping pull combatants apart. Because of that, one girl was arrested for battery. All three were arrested for disorderly conduct. Released 10/02/2018 at 9:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
