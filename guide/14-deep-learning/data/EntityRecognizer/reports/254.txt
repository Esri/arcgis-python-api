A 57-year-old Madison man took one blue paintball directly to the chest. A couple, eating frozen custard inside their car, were startled when additional paintballs hit their vehicle. In total, witnesses reported 25 to 30 rounds were fired Friday night in the parking lot of Culver's, 4301 East Towne Blvd. In addition, employees at nearby Dick's Sporting Goods reported the same suspects had shot 15 paintballs at a door of the store. Thanks to witnesses, evidence left at the scene, and surveillance images, responding MPD officers were able to put out information on the getaway car, which Monona Police officers spotted and pulled over on Highway 12, near Stoughton Rd.  Two paintball guns, 500 blue paintballs, and few bindles of crack cocaine were recovered.   Released 04/08/2019 at 10:20 AM by PIO Joel Despain
