 The MPD has identified a registered sex offender as the person who made contact with a 13-year-old girl on Powers Ave. last week. She told police a stranger waived her over to the window of his white van on Tuesday afternoon, around 3:30 p.m., and asked how old she was. The child got uncomfortable, walked away, and reported the contact to a parent. On Thursday, while walking home, the same girl saw the van again and felt it was following her. She was able to get a license plate number. Utilizing it, the MPD was able to locate the van, and later its driver. He said he recently moved into the neighborhood and acknowledged contacting a girl while seeking directions. The man, who is in his 50's, is no longer on supervision, and officers did not have probable cause to arrest him for a crime. Information on the case has been shared with all MPD officers and with the Madison Metropolitan School District. Children are encouraged to avoid contact with motorists they do not know, and immediately report – like the girl in this case did - suspicious encounters to trusted adults so police can be notified.      Released 10/17/2016 at 11:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
