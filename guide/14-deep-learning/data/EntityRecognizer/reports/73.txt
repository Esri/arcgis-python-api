 Multiple citizens called 911, and a couple of passersby intervened, scaring off a suspect after he brutally battered, strangled, and stomped on a 29-year-old woman Thursday night outside of the BP gas station, 318 S. Park St. The victim - who believes she was knocked unconscious for a period of time and thought she was going to die - was taken to a hospital with non life-threatening injuries. She told police the attack was unprovoked, but that she has had past contact with her assailant. She says both are homeless and got into a dispute over money in the downtown area in the past couple of weeks. The suspect fled in a car and remains at large.
