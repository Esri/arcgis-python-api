Officers chased down three suspects, two who had committed retail theft and a third who threatened the clerk at Riley's Wines of the World. Officers apprehended a juvenile and Lexus Nelson, 19, of Madison in the 500 block of W. Johnson St. after attempting to elude officers for several blocks. After interviewing the two women and citing them for retail theft, officers were led to the third suspect, Demorris Posley, who had grabbed a bottle of liquor and threatened the clerk at the counter prior to fleeing with Nelson and the juvenile. Posley turned himself in the next morning after officers tracked down his girlfriend. Posley was booked into the Dane County Jail for strong armed robbery. Released 07/11/2018 at 3:04 PM by P.O.
