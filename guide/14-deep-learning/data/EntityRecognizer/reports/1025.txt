 "I'm drunk; can we just go to jail?" Those were the first words a driver of a significantly damaged van said to a responding police officer last evening. He had struck several parked cars, and one victim contacted police after the van came to a stop at the intersection of N. Sherman Ave. and N. Brearly St. The front driver's side wheel was missing and air bags had deployed. The driver was not initially moving, but came around as the officer investigated. There were many full and empty beer cans in the van and the driver indicated he had also been drinking at a bar. He did not realize he had been involved in a crash.
