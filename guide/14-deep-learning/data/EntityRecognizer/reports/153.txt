 When a downtown resident heard a burglar attempting to enter his home early this morning, he went to his gun safe and retrieved his handgun. With the burglar's upper body inside the victim's kitchen window, the victim pointed his weapon at the would-be intruder and told him to leave. The victim's partner also announced she was calling the police. The stranger took off running. Responding officers determined he had cut a screen in an attempt to gain entry. Two children were asleep inside the residence. They did not awaken during the incident. Released 08/31/2018 at 9:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
