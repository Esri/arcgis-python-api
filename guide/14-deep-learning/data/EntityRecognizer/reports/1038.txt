 A loud argument between two groups of men escalated when one pulled a knife and made threatening statements. The face-off was taking place early Sunday morning just outside of the State Street Campus Ramp, 415 N. Lake St. MPD officers were on the scene immediately and took the man who brandished the weapon into custody. It's believed the MPD's presence is likely what interrupted a sexual assault that was taking place inside of the ramp. The MPD has additional officers assigned to the entertainment district on Friday and Saturday nights. Released 10/03/2016 at 10:13 AM by PIO Joel Despain
