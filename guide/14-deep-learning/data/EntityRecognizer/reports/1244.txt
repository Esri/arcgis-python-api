A 57-year-old Madison man has been swindled out of $19,000 after he allowed criminals to remotely control his computer. It all started when it locked up, and a message appeared on the screen instructing him to contact "Microsoft." He followed instructions, and called someone who offered to remotely install antivirus software. This set into motion a series of confusing "fixes" and payments. Eventually some money was to be refunded to the victim. He provided access to his bank account so the "refund" could be deposited. Somehow what was to be an $800 deposit showed up as $8,000. Now the victim was told he needed to pay the "company" back. He did so by purchasing thousands of dollars in gift cards. He gave the caller their numbers. That money was lost, and then thousands of dollars more disappeared from his bank account: $19,000 in total losses.  Released 03/01/2019 at 10:03 AM by PIO Joel Despain
