A Belleville man said he was scared, because "you just never know" after another driver began waving a handgun around during road rage incident that began on S. Stoughton Rd. yesterday afternoon. The victim said he cut close to the suspect's car while making a lane change. This led to the suspect flipping him off, and later pulling out the weapon. The victim got the suspect's license plate and police located the car a short time later. The gun turned out to be one that contains BBs, but looks real. The suspect said he pulled it out because he thought the other driver was reaching for something.  Released 12/23/2015 at 8:24 AM by PIO Joel Despain
