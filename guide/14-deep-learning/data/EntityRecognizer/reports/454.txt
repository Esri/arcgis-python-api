Several people, including a pregnant woman, were victims of a rock throwing incident at the corner of N. Lake St. and State St. Sunday afternoon. Witnesses said an angry man was hurling rocks at humans and cars, and also knocked over a moped and motor cycle that were parked nearby. When passersby looked at the suspect, he would put his hands up - as if looking for a fight - while saying: "What's up?" Officers arrived and took him into custody Released 06/04/2018 at 10:13 AM by PIO Joel Despain
