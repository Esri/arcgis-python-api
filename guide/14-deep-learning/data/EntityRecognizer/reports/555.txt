 Two young men were arrested for cruelty to animals after three chickens and a rabbit were killed Saturday night. The animals were in a shed, or chicken coop, located on the grounds of the Greenway Crossing Montessori School, 1325 Greenway Cross. Private security guards heard a "pop" sound coming from the location, and next saw two suspects running. The guards were able to detain the young men as the MPD was called. A bloody hammer and garden tools were found near the location of the dead animals. Released 05/30/2017 at 9:42 AM by PIO Joel Despain
