 The MPD recovered a BB gun from Toki Middle School this morning. It had been concealed in the backpack of a 13-year-old student. School staff members received a tip about the young man potentially being in possession of a weapon which led to the backpack being checked. Released 03/06/2018 at 3:27 PM by PIO Joel Despain
