 A distraught Mt. Horeb woman walked to a nearby restaurant to summon help following a bump-and-run carjacking on the West Beltline Highway last night. The 32-year-old was westbound when a SUV began tailgating her. The driver of the SUV eventually rear ended her car, and she pulled over near the S. Park St. exit. The SUV pulled in behind her. Three men got out with one yelling at the woman, telling her to take a look at the damage to front bumper of the SUV. The woman, realizing this was not going to be a good situation, said she was going back to her car, to get her phone, so police could be called. Her thought was that it would be best for the MPD to sort out the situation and to not engage the men. However, before she could get back in the driver's seat, one of the men pushed past and assumed that position. He drove off in her car, while the two co-conspirators returned to the SUV and sped away. The MPD aired an attempt to locate on the stolen car. Milwaukee Police called a couple of hours later saying the it was just used in an armed robbery at a Walgreens. Milwaukee has seen many crimes similar to what took place on the W. Beltline Highway, but this bigger city crime is relatively new for the Capital City. Released 09/23/2016 at 11:40 AM by PIO Joel Despain
