 It is part of his routine, every day he goes to James Madison Park to feed the ducks. He knows some of those who hang in the area from the streets, and as he passed a picnic table one man called out: "Do you have any beer?" He did have one in hand, and shared it. The man chugged it down. Some at the table began asking the duck feeder for money. They wanted to go buy some more beer. The 54-year-old said this led to a woman forcefully taking money from his wallet. When he tried to get it back, he said the woman and a man from the table attacked him. He says he was punched, kicked, and possibly hit with a stick. Officers were called to a fight in progress, and arrived to find the victim visibly shaken with a big knot on his head, and cuts on his arms. The suspects had left the area, but thanks to area surveillance cameras, officers were able to find them walking not far from the park. They were taken into custody on tentative charges listed above.
