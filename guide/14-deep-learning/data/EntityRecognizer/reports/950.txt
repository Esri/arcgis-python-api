Officers responded to a suspicious person complaint after the eighteen year old victim was walking alone and followed by a white male. The victim first saw the male driving an older model red pickup truck near the DMV on Bartillon Drive. The victim then walks down Onsgard to Lein/Mendota and again sees this male who walks up, tries grabbing her by the arm and says "I can get you if I want to" and "I know where you'll be at". The victim was able to pull away and ran to safety. Released 11/28/2017 at 8:35 PM by Sgt. Matthew Baker
