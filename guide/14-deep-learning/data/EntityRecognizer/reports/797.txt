Officers peacefully resolve barricaded standoff Madison Police officers responded to a man having a medical emergency at a local hotel in the 8000 block of Excelsior Dr. that had barricaded himself from medical personnel trying to assist him Thursday afternoon. Officers were able to convince Thomas Ledwell, 38, of Joliet, IL, to come out of the hotel room peacefully after Ledwell had used bedding and other hotel room items to keep medical personnel out of the room. It became clear to officers that the medical issue was not only non-emergent at that point but also drug-use related. Officers took Ledwell into custody and accompanied Ledwell to UW-Hospital for treatment. Ledwell cooperated with officers and medical staff after arriving at the hospital. He received misdemeanor citations for illegal possession of schedule I narcotics and possession of drug paraphernalia and was released for medical care.     Released 04/14/2017 at 12:06 PM by P.O.
