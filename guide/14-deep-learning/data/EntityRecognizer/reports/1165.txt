Officers responded to a motor vehicle accident on US Highway 12 at County Highway AB.  Initial investigation suggests that Hernandez Salguero's vehicle was travelling south bound on AB and proceeded through the intersection at Highway 12, striking a semi that was travelling east bound on Highway 12.  After the initial collision, another vehicle struck the same suspect vehicle.  The driver of the suspect vehicle, Hernandez Salguero, was transported to the hospital for treatment of what initially appeared to be significant injuries, later determined to be non-life threatening.  East bound Hy 12 was shut down during the investigation, but all lanes are once again open.  Hernandez Salguero was cited for OMVWI (2nd offense) and failure to yield.
