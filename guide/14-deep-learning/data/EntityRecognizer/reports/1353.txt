The MPD was called to a hospital yesterday morning to take a sexual assault report. A 23-year-old woman said she was assaulted in the back of a car sometime overnight, and thought this may have happened in the area of Paterson St. She believes she was struck in the head and pulled into the car. She was unable to describe it, and said her assailant was "tall" and "skinny." She believes he may have been Hispanic. The woman said the man pulled her out of the car following the assault. Several hours later she went to a hospital where she reported the incident. Released 09/13/2018 at 10:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
