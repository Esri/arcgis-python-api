The MPD is seeking your help in locating a missing 53-year-old man. Michael MacNeil walked away from a group home, located in the MPD's East District on September 9th. There is no reason to believe he is the victim of a crime, but there is concern for his welfare as he is on medication, which he does not have with him. Michael is 6', 165-pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. He has a goatee and wears glasses. Michael was last seen wearing a green and white polo shirt and blue jeans. Michael is forgetful and gets disoriented easily. He does not have a cell phone. Anyone seeing Michael is asked to call 911. Released 09/19/2016 at 3:07 PM by PIO Joel Despain
