 A mother walking with her young daughter was randomly attacked while walking on N. Livingston St. yesterday afternoon. The victim said at first a strange man began yelling at her and acting crazy swung. She was fearful what he might do. He pursued the mother and child, swinging a heavy leather coat, striking woman in the head. Another 21-year-old Madison woman said the same suspect yelled profanities at her, and she was ready to use pepper spray on him, if he had advanced any closer. A separate witness said the 50-year-old man also swung a chair at a parked car at Livingston St. and East Washington Ave., smashing out a rear windshield. The MPD was able to take the suspect into custody. He had been drinking, and repeatedly spoke about sexually assaulting women as he was taken to jail.
