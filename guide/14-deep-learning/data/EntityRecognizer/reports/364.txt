 The MPD is on the scene of a robbery. The Old National Bank, 216 Cottage Grove Rd., was hit less than an hour ago by a man wearing a dark scarf over his face. He said he had a gun and fled with cash. Witnesses believe the robber got into an older, dark, four-door sedan with a bad muffler. It was driven by someone else, and he was the passenger. Anyone with information is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 266-6014. Released 02/02/2017 at 3:20 PM by PIO Joel Despain
