On June 23, 2018, MPD officers were dispatched to Kwik Trip at 1625 N Stoughton Road.  Employees there recognized a suspect from a previously reported theft case. When officers arrived to investigate, the suspect, Antonio Rowe fled in a red Chrysler Sebring.  Officers checking the area located the vehicle and Rowe on Straubel Street.  Rowe again fled, this time on foot.  Officers were able to take him into custody without further incident. It was learned the Chrysler had been reported stolen from North Third Street on June 15, 2018.  The vehicle was returned to the owner. Rowe was booked into the Dane County jail on tentative charges of Operating a Motor Vehicle Without Owner's Consent, Resisting an Officer, and two traffic citations. Rowe, who is under state supervision, was also held on a parole hold.  He explained to officers that he fled from them because his agent had told him to not have police contact.  Released 06/25/2018 at 9:29 AM by P.O.
