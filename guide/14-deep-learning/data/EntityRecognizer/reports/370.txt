 A pedestrian walking down the street took cover, and a woman who was driving in the area ducked down, as shots rang out near the intersection of Kedzie St. and Commercial Ave. Saturday afternoon. Just prior to the gunfire, a witnesse saw an arm stick out of the passenger side window of an older model silver minivan. Whoever it belonged to was holding an 8 to 10 inch gun. Soon, multiple shots were ringing out. At the same time witnesses saw a black car drive quickly from the area. It's not known if that was the intended target. Shell casings were recovered, but there were no reports of injuries of property damage. Released 10/09/2017 at 12:46 PM by PIO Joel Despain
