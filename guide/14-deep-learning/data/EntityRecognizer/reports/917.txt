 A concerned Madison man intervened and tried to stop a drunken driver from leaving a downtown parking ramp with a child in her car Saturday evening. The witness saw the woman stagger to her car with the young boy, get in and drive into a concrete wall of the Capitol Square South parking garage, 113. S. Henry St. The witness went up to the car and told the driver she needed to park the car because she was drunk and had a child with her. The woman attempted to drive away, but a queue of cars was causing a backup and she was forced to repark her car. She got out with the child and walked off. The concerned citizen followed her as police responded and helped officers locate the driver, who was still in the ramp. She was arrested for sixth offense drunken driving with a passenger under 16-years-old. The child was turned over to a trusted adult. Released 09/05/2017 at 12:35 PM by PIO Joel Despain
