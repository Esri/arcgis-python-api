 Dane County Narcotics Task Force detectives say he was a "very active" Madison drug dealer with some of his business transactions taking place in the N. Thompson Dr. area.  They are using the word "was" because the 24-year-old is now off the streets following a monthslong investigation that culminated with the suspect's arrest following a traffic stop in Sun Prairie last week.   The Task Force was assisted by Sun Prairie Police in peacefully taking him into custody. He had more than 50 baggies of cocaine on his person at the time of apprehension. Released 05/07/2018 at 10:54 AM by PIO Joel Despain
