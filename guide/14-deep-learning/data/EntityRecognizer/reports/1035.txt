 A Madison mother had her four-year-old son with her yesterday when she got into a road rage incident with another driver. She said she was cutoff. This led to horn honking, and words, as both drivers pulled into a parking lot in the 3500 block of Anderson St. The woman said she remained in her car, but the other driver got out, and was holding a crowbar. She says he used it to strike her vehicle. She recorded images of the man on her cellphone and then drove to a nearby business to call police. Officers located the other driver, who was still in the area. He said he only struck the woman's car after one of her tires rolled over his foot. The man was arrested on tentative charges which are listed above. Released 01/31/2019 at 9:07 AM by PIO Joel Despain
