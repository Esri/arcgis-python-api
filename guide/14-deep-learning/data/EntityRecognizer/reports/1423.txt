 A Madison Police officer went to the hospital with an arm injury after being thrown to the pavement in the 600 block of University Ave. early Sunday morning. The man who attacked her was with a group of people who got off of a party bus, and were carrying plastic cups containing alcohol. MPD officers, working special downtown safety initiative hours, let the group know they could not possess alcohol on the street. One man tried to hide his cup, and was told he would be getting a citation. Others with him were angered by this and a large disturbance broke out, during which time the officer was battered. Three ended up going to jail on tentative charges listed above. Released 10/10/2016 at 3:18 PM by PIO Joel Despain
