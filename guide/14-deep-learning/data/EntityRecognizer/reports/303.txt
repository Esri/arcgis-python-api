 The MPD was dispatched to W. Badger Rd. early Sunday morning after a man was found passed out behind the wheel of a car that was running and in the roadway with its hazards on. Doors were locked and took lots of knocks on the driver's window to get him to wake up. When he did, he began to yell, and instead of turning off the engine as he was instructed, he started driving, but not far. The officer contacted the man again in the 2100 block of S. Park St. He is a concealed carry permit holder, and had a handgun on his hip. He was arrested on tentative charges which are listed above. Released 12/18/2018 at 12:12 PM by PIO Joel Despain
