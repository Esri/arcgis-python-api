Several officers responded to the 3700 block of Kipling Dr. early Sunday morning for a report of a woman threatening another with a gun. The disturbance, which included a lot of yelling, was taking place in a public hallway of an apartment building.  When officers arrived, the suspect was outside. She had a handgun tucked in her pants and was arrested for second degree reckless endangerment. A 35-year-old resident said the suspect had been inside the building looking for a man who lives in one of the apartments. He was not at home, but this did not stop the suspect from making a number of very loud statements regarding his whereabouts. Many in the building became concerned, including the victim who told the suspect police were going to be called. She said the suspect replied, "I don't care, the pigs won't do anything." The victim said the suspect had the gun pointed at her face, but then took off as squad cars rolled up.     Released 11/26/2018 at 10:34 AM by PIO Joel Despain
