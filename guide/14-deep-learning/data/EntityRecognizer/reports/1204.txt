During the early morning hours of June 13th, 2018, a 45-year-old female was awakened by a burglar, in the 2800 block of Commercial Ave.  From all indications, it was determined that the suspect had entered the residence, through an unlocked window, and probably had spent a significant amount of time inside the home; as he had moved a purse and computer bag from its original location.  When the victim realized a male subject was standing over her, after having groped her as she was sleeping on the sofa, he engaged the home owner in conversation; with a bandana covering his face and pointing a gun at her head! The suspect was reported to not have a shirt on, but continued to ask questions about what money/credit cards she possessed.  He attempted to get the victim to leave the residence, in order to go to a nearby ATM machine, but the victim refused and cited that other family members in the home might create problems for the suspect if they were to wake up.  The suspect proceeded to take the victims purse, which contained cash and cell phones, and left the residence through the same window he had entered earlier. Responding officers were able to locate most of the victim's property, and a K9 track was conducted; with no success.  This matter continues to be investigated, but anyone with any information about this case should contact the Madison Police Department immediately.  PO Howard Payne  Released 06/13/2018 at 9:23 AM by P.O.
