The owner of a 2014 Audi S7 Premium Quattro was on the second level of a downtown parking ramp taking photos of his car late Saturday night. It was parked below on Hawthorne Court. He would later tell police he purchased the S7 several months ago for $85,000. While capturing images, he had a friend keeping an eye on the Audi to make sure nobody messed with it, but that did not go as planned. Three men approached, and one decided to get in the driver's seat. The owner's friend tried to intervene, but it was too late. The man behind the wheel gunned the 420 horsepower V-8 engine in reverse, smoking the tires, and sending several people ducking for cover. The Audi slammed into a parked car, stopping it before it got to nearby University Avenue where many pedestrians were on the sidewalk. The driver took off, but passersby helped officers locate him. He was arrested on a number of tentative charges. They are listed above. The car's owner estimated damages to his prized Audi at up to $30,000. Released 01/14/2019 at 3:54 PM by PIO Joel Despain
