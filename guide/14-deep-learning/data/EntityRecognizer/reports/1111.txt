A Georgia man, who is visiting the Capitol City, has found negotiating Isthmus roadways challenging. When the Atlanta native was pulled over early Saturday morning for driving against traffic in the 400 block of West Gilman, he remarked to an officer: "One ways are everywhere!" It didn't help his navigation skills that he had been drinking. The Saturday stop marked the second time in a week that Central District officers have arrested the man for operating while intoxicated. His first arrest, for the same offense, came on June 4th. It was just before 1:00 a.m., and an officer saw the man's car drifting in and out of traffic lanes on Johnson and Bassett Streets. Now, fast-forward to early this morning. It was about 3:20 a.m. An officer was in his squad at the corner of N. Butler St. and E. Gilman St. when the visitor from Atlanta pulled up to ask directions. The officer recognized the driver from the previous couple of weeks, and realized he was intoxicated again. The man was processed for his third offense of drunken driving this month. Inside his car, officers found paperwork from the previous two OWI arrests, as well as another citation - issued by an MPD officer last Thursday - for hit-and-run.     Released 06/19/2019 at 10:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
