 A Madison man was recently scammed out of $300 after being convinced he had been contacted by someone from Apple. The MPD has gotten several complaints recently from people who have gotten multiple bogus phone calls that appear to be coming from the company. In the case of the 69-year-old victim from last week, he was contacted by a person claiming to be with AppleCare. The victim was made to believe his phone and laptop had been hacked. He allowed the caller to take remote control of his computer to fix "problems." For the "service" he paid the caller $300 in Apple gift cards. When he was pushed for additional funds, the victim became suspicious. He contacted the real AppleCare and learned this was a fraud. That's when he notified police.
