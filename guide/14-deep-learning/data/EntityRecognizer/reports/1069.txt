A Madison woman was arrested last night after significantly damaging a black Cadillac that was parked on S. Bedford St. Witnesses saw the suspect swinging some type of object - which investigating officers believe was a tire iron - smashing the cars headlights, taillights, rear window, and mirrors. There were dents and scratches.  The car's tires were slashed and flat. A man with whom the suspect had a past relationship is believed to have been driving the Cadillac. He could not be immediately located. An open bottle of liquor was found in the suspect's SUV. Released 05/18/2016 at 12:13 PM by PIO Joel Despain
