 A husband and wife recently moved into a new home in the 800 block of E. Johnson St. Last night they had a friend over for dinner, and were seated at the table when three men burst through an unlocked backdoor. One had a gun. Another grabbed a large kitchen knife off a counter. All were demanding money and intimating that they knew the residents were drug dealers. The shocked and scared victims assured they had just moved in, and they had nothing to do with illicit activities. The intruders ended up taking the victims' cell phones and some cash from the dinner guest after he tried to buy his phone back from the men. They took his money, kept his phone, and drove off in a dark colored older sedan.  Released 04/22/2019 at 9:22 AM by PIO Joel Despain
