 A lot of people called 911 last night after hearing gunfire near Wheeler and School Roads. Officers arrived and found seven .45 caliber casings near a stop sign on the south side of Wheeler. A homeowner thought his house may have been struck as he felt something hit it as shots rang out. In the dark of night, neither he nor officers could find damage. There were no reports of injuries. Another witness saw a car speed through the area at the time of the reports. Released 12/07/2017 at 9:12 AM by PIO Joel Despain
