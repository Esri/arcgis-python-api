A pizza delivery driver was the victim of an attempted armed robbery Friday night. The 54-year-old had just delivered to an apartment on Freemont Ave. when a gunman approached demanding money. The victim gave him nothing, and instead returned to the address he had just left, pounding on the door, ringing the bell and yelling for police to be called. As he did this, the would-be robber fled empty-handed.  Released 12/11/2017 at 9:43 AM by PIO Joel Despain
