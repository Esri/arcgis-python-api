 An argument amongst high school students on a packed Madison Metro bus Thursday afternoon turned into a true melee when two girls decided to unleash pepper spray on a couple of those with whom they were feuding. The driver pulled over on W. Broadway near Hoboken Rd., and when officers arrived 40 to 50 young people were running around, many of them screaming. Three girls were identified as primary aggressors. One was cited for disorderly conduct and released. Two others were taken to the Juvenile Reception Center on tentative state charges of disorderly conduct. The MPD thanks the Monona Police Department, the McFarland Police Department, and the Wisconsin State Patrol for assistance in calming things down. We also appreciate the efforts of Madison Fire Department paramedics who provided medical assistance to those who had gotten the strongest doses of pepper spray.
