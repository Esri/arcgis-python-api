 The MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit arrested a homeless man Wednesday afternoon in connection with three downtown burglaries. All took place in early January and involved someone breaking into downtown residential parking garages. In two cases, bicycles were stolen; in the third case a cell phone and other property were taken from a car. The bikes and the cell phone were quickly pawned, and BCU detectives were able to identify the suspect as the person who sold the stolen items. He denied committing burglaries, and claimed to be pawning items for a friend. The suspect was arrested on several counts of theft.   Released 03/02/2017 at 9:21 AM by PIO Joel Despain
