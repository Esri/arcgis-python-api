Madison Police hostage negotiators and SWAT team members are currently working a barricaded person call in the 3600 block of Kipling Dr. A reverse 911 call was initiated, urging residents to stay sheltered until this incident is resolved. Motorists are asked to stay away from this area until further notice. MPD has been on this scene since 2:30 p.m. attempting to urge a wanted party to surrender himself for outstanding charges involving weapons and violence. It appears that there is an adult female who has two children under the age of 5 also in the apartment.
