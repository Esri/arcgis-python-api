 A funeral was disrupted this afternoon when a gunman fired one shot into the air. He then pointed the weapon at people who had gathered at a gravesite. Mourners fled to their cars and drove away from Sunset Memory Gardens, 7302 Mineral Point Rd. The armed man got into a white sedan. Detectives say this was not a random act of violence and that the suspect appears to be acquainted with some who were attending the ceremony.      Released 05/11/2018 at 3:21 PM by PIO Joel Despain
