 There was an overnight burglary in the Walnut Grove Neighborhood on Winterset Circle, and footprints in the snow show two sets of tracks going up to other homes as well. Criminals were likely looking for more unlocked doors. At the house that was hit, there was an unsecured porch and sliding glass door. Electronics were stolen. The MPD was called to the residence early this morning. Released 01/29/2018 at 2:10 PM by PIO Joel Despain
