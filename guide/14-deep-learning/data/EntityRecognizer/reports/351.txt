Road rage this morning ended with one driver pulling a knife and flashing its curved blade near the face of another. It was not immediately clear what triggered hostilities between the two motorists. They exchanged words and gestures as both operated in the 4200 block of School Rd. around 7:30 a.m. Both stopped, with the knife-wielding man getting out of his car and approaching the other driver. Following the weapons violation, the suspect drove off and the victim called the MPD. Released 04/04/2018 at 2:13 PM by PIO Joel Despain
