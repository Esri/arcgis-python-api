     A 29-year-old man, who has a history of victimizing women via lewd and lascivious behavior, was arrested again by the MPD this morning on three counts of bail jumping.     Javonte JC Woods, age 29, no permanent address, was located in the 600 block of East Washington Ave. by Central District officers. They were seeking him after he went back inside a N. Frances St., high-rise apartment building Sunday afternoon. A female victim from a previous case spotted him using a computer in a common area of the building.     She called police and was shaken when officers arrived. Woods is currently banned from the 400 and 500 blocks of N. Frances St., having exposed himself to the woman, inside the same apartment building, on February 12th. Central District officers arrested him for stalking, lewd and lascivious behavior, and bail jumping following the incident.     Woods was also arrested for lewd and lascivious behavior after he exposed himself to two women at a Williamson St. business on December 27th of this past year.   Released 02/18/2019 at 12:14 PM by PIO Joel Despain
