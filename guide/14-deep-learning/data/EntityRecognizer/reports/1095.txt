An Independence Lane resident said a stranger tried to stop her in the parking lot of her apartment building early Saturday morning, and she believes he pointed a handgun at her. The 50-year-old says the man told her to stop, but she ignored him and got inside her residence to call police. She was not harmed and the man fled before police arrived.
