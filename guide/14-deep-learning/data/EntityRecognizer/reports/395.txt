 A 20-year-old downtown resident suffered a concussion and facial injuries after the moped she was operating, in a designated bicycle lane, collided a car Thursday afternoon on South Park St. Witnesses said the injured woman was going relatively fast, between 25 and 30 mph, when the moped hit the rear of a car that had just about completed a left turn from northbound S. Park Street onto Chandler Street. The driver, who was not impaired, had checked the bike lane before making the turn, but did not see any bicycles. The injured woman, who was not wearing a helmet, was cited for driving on a bicycle lane or way. Released 04/19/2019 at 11:48 AM by PIO Joel Despain
