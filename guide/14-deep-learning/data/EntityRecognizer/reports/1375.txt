 Concerned passersby came to the aid of a 25-year-old Madison man as he was being beaten and stomped on early this morning near the intersection of N. Henry St. and State St. Witnesses said the victim exchanged words with four men, and that the foursome then attacked the victim. They said one suspect was grabbing the injured man's head and slamming it on the ground. The group fled as citizens intervened. One - the suspect who had allegedly bashed the victim's head on pavement - was later located and arrested by police following a traffic stop. The victim was disoriented, but conscious when officers arrived. He was treated at a hospital for his injuries. Released 05/16/2018 at 10:33 AM by PIO Joel Despain
