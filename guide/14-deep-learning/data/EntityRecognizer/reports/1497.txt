 A witness believes a racially motivated argument led to a battery early Sunday morning in the 200 block of W. Gorham St. It left an intoxicated 29-year-old Madison man unconscious. The witness heard the victim telling several young African American men, "You a gangsta." He was reportedly making the statement over and over. The witness said one young man responded: "On my mama, I'm going to hit him." And the witness said the young man followed through, punching the victim once in the head, knocking him out. When he came around, he could not remember what happened, and was taken to the detox center. Released 09/05/2017 at 11:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
