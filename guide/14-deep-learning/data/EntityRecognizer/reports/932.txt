 A Madison couple was awakened early this morning by the sounds of a stranger ringing their Hillcrest Dr. home's doorbell. The husband looked out to see a young man lacking a shirt or shoes. The homeowner went outside to provide assistance. It appeared the caller had suffered some abrasions and he seemed disoriented. Police and paramedics responded. The 21-year-old told officers he had been mugged and that robbers took not only his shirt and shoes but also his wallet and cell phone. The Poynette man did not wish to make a full accounting of his night in Madison, but did say that he and a friend had road tripped here from the Wisconsin Dells. They were downtown and got separated. When he got back to where his friend had parked the car, it was gone. Now needing a lift back to Poynette, he says he offered some random people cash for a ride. They accepted the officer, but instead of heading north, they went west, driving the victim to a Madison park where he was battered, robbed, and injured by a Taser type device. Shirtless, shoeless - with no money or phone - he wandered until he found a home with outdoor lights on, and he started ringing the bell. Released 09/15/2017 at 11:47 AM by PIO Joel Despain
