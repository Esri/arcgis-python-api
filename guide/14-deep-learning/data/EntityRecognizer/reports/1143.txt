A very tall man gave a clerk change to purchase some candy, and when she opened the cash register, he made a grab for the money. The crime took place late yesterday afternoon inside Open Pantry, 1412 Pflaum Rd. The employee struggled briefly with the robber before he was able to take off with cash from the till. No weapon was implied or seen. Released 04/07/2017 at 9:11 AM by PIO Joel Despain
