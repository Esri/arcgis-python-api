 A security guard was threatened and ordered to the floor after confronting a burglar inside East Towne Mall early this morning. A masked man implied he was armed, although no weapon was seen. The investigation revealed he had broken a window to gain access to the mall. Once inside, he targeted a jewelry kiosk, breaking display glass, and stealing chains, earrings and pendants. The MPD's Burglary Crimes Unit will be investigating. Released 04/11/2018 at 9:23 AM by PIO Joel Despain
