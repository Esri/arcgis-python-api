 A shotgun stolen in a west side burglary three years ago was among items seized as Madison SWAT and the Dane County Narcotics Task Force executed a search warrant on a Clyde Gallagher apartment Tuesday morning following a heroin peddling investigation. A 23-year-old Madison man was arrested on numerous tentative charges including heroin delivery. A digital scale, other drug paraphernalia, cell phones, shotgun ammunition, and cash were also confiscated. The shotgun was taken in a Prairie Rd. residential burglary in September of 2013.
