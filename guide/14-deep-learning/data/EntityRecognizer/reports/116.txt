Three handguns and more than $28,000 cash were among items seized this week as the Dane County Narcotics Task Force arrested three men for heroin peddling.

Fonza, age 22 Geonni N. Bryant, age 19 Anthony S. Douglas, age 30  Confiscated from the Deerfield target were three handguns, ammunition, a digital scale and more than $6,000. Confiscated from the Fitchburg target were two digital scales, eight cell phones, and more than $22,000.    Released 01/19/2017 at 10:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
