MPD officers were notified of a battery in progress Friday afternoon after an attentive security guard called 911 to report the incident. As officers arrived on scene, the security guard identified the intoxicated suspect to officers. Officers contacted the suspect, Vaughn, as she was preparing to leave the area on a bicycle. Further investigation into the battery showed that Vaughn followed the first victim on foot after a verbal argument and struck the victim from behind causing the victim to fall to the ground. Vaughn then approached the second victim and punched her in the face. Officers placed Vaughn under arrest for battering both victims. While transporting Vaughn to the Dane County Jail, Vaughn made numerous threats of physical harm to the arresting officer resulting in the added charge of threats to injure a law enforcement officer. The city cameras proved to be a useful tool for the officers investigating this case. Released 06/24/2019 at 11:22 AM by P.O. Joseph Buccellato
