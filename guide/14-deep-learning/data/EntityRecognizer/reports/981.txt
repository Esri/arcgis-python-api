 A suspect, who was concealing a fully loaded handgun in a sweatshirt pocket, fought with officers as they tried to apprehend him inside a University Ave. nightclub Saturday night. One officer had spotted the suspect outside of The Double U bar and recognized him as someone wanted on a warrant for operating a motor vehicle without owner's consent. It was issued after the suspect ran from police on the night of May 30th after he was pulled over on Britta Parkway while traveling in a stolen car. When the MPD contacted him this past weekend, he ran into the bar. An officer tackled the suspect. Multiple onlookers used phones to record the arrest as two officers worked in concert with one another to safely secure the scene. The suspect also had a bag containing narcotics which were individually packaged. He was arrested on numerous tentative charges. Released 06/20/2017 at 12:38 PM by PIO Joel Despain
