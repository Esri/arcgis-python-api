Criminals tried, with mixed success, to pass several phony $100 bills on the West Side last night. The preliminary investigation suggests the cases are connected. In the first, three women – separately- entered Walmart, 7202 Watts Rd., around 6:25 p.m. Each attempted to make purchases of only a couple of dollars with fake $100 bills. The women were unsuccessful. One took off with a counterfeit $100, but two other bogus bills were turned over to police when the MPD was called to respond around 8:15 p.m. In the second case, two women entered West Towne's Lane Bryant store - again separately - around 6:45 p.m. Each successfully made purchases of around $10 and were given cash back after presenting $100 bills. An employee later realized the bills were not real and police were called around 8:30 p.m. In the third case, two women bought a couple of sandwich combos at Firehouse Subs, 7854 Mineral Point Rd. They paid for the food with a $100 bill. It was also later deemed to also be counterfeit and the MPD was notified shortly after 10:00 p.m. Scotch tape was used as the security strip of some bills, and three had the same serial number: the two passed at Lane Bryant and one of those recovered from Walmart.  Released 01/07/2016 at 10:19 AM by PIO Joel Despain
