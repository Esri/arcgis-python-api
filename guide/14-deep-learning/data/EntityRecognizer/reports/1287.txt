 The MPD was called to a fight in the 500 block of State St. early this morning. Witnesses said there was a primary aggressor who punched and knocked down three different men: two of them were temporarily unconscious. Some believed the man throwing the quick punches must have been trained as a fighter. He fled before officers got to the scene. One victim needed a couple of stitches, but there were no serious injuries. Released 05/25/2018 at 9:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
