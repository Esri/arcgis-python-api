 Over the noon hour, a young boy approached a woman while she sat in her car outside of Kwik Trip, 3528 E. Washington Ave. He said he needed $2 for the bus. She took out her money, and was about to count out the requested amount, when the child reached in and grabbed all of her cash. He peddled off on a silver mountain bike. The victim estimated he was around 12-years-old. Released 11/06/2018 at 2:11 PM by PIO Joel Despain
