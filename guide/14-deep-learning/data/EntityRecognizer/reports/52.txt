 The MPD arrested four teenagers Tuesday following an investigation into a videotaped battery that took place at the Villager Mall's parking lot on October 27th. A 15-year-old boy is accused of encouraging two 14-year-old girls to throw multiple punches at the victim, who is also a 14-year-old girl. Another girl, also 14, videotaped the violence and later posted it on her Facebook page. The victim was not seriously injured in the attack, but told police one of the assailants knocked her out in a separate fight that took place near S. Park St. on the day prior, the 26th of October. There is an ongoing dispute between the victim and suspects. All have been told resolving issues with violence will not be tolerated by the MPD. Released 11/02/2016 at 11:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
