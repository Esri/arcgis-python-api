A citizen witness, who supplied the MPD with a photo of a possible getaway car, helped the Burglary Crimes Unit crack several package theft cases. Manuel A. Diaz, Sr., age 52, Madison, was arrested yesterday for three counts of mail fraud after detectives recovered evidence from inside his home and from inside his recycle bin. The investigation began in late January when a couple of packages were stolen from outside Potter St. homes shortly after being delivered by UPS. A neighbor saw someone going up to one of the targeted residences. Suspicious, he took a photo of the car the suspect was driving. Investigators would later locate it parked outside the suspect's residence. In his home, and his recycle bin they found evidence connecting the suspect to several package theft cases, including one of those that took place on Potter St. Released 04/06/2016 at 12:11 PM by PIO Joel Despain
