An intoxicated Whitewater man told police he likely fell down and hit his head early Saturday morning, but surveillance video told a different story. It shows the 29-year-old pushing and striking people in the 600 block of University Ave. until someone delivers a blow to his head that renders him unconscious for a couple of minutes. The out-of-town visitor suffered facial injuries and a large knot to the back of the head. He was treated at a hospital. Released 11/07/2016 at 10:09 AM by PIO Joel Despain
