 A 75-year-old Madison man was found deceased outside of his Graceland Ave. home Wednesday afternoon. He had health issues, but arctic conditions may have played a role in his death. It will be up to theDane County Medical Examiner to make that determination. In the past week, hypothermia has been a contributing factor in two Madison deaths.
