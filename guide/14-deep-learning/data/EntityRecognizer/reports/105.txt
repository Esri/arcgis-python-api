 A fight between roommates on N. Walbridge Ave. early this morning turned bloody when a knife was brought into the dispute. The men, both aged 24, ended up with multiple stab wounds. One was located by police at the residence; the other was being driven to a hospital by a friend when officers intercepted the car to provide aid, and to get the injured man into an ambulance. He was listed in guarded condition, although medical staff members expect he will survive. The roommate who called police, and who was found at the residence was listed in stable condition. Neither man has been arrested at this point as detectives are still in the midst of sorting out what exactly transpired. Released 12/23/2016 at 9:20 AM by PIO Joel Despain
