Inside the Walmart, she was yelling, swearing and flipping papers off of the service desk. The disturbance was enough for staff members to call for a police response. When a MPD officer rolled up to the Nakoosa Trail store Monday night, she encountered a distraught 24-year-old "suspect," who was now outside. When the woman saw the officer, she was about to cry. The officer asked what was happening, and the woman said she was not going to lie. "I was belligerent" inside the Walmart she said, explaining that she had come to exchange two cans of baby formula for milk, but was denied because she had no receipt. The woman explained a friend had actually purchased the formula the day prior using the victim's food stamp card. The "suspect" had asked the friend to pick up milk as she needed some for her baby. Somehow the friend got the request confused and purchased formula, which the "suspect" says she does not need because her baby is two. So, she just spent a couple of hours, by foot and buy bus, getting to the Walmart to make the exchange, which did not happen, and she has very little money left on her food stamp card. Now she was going to have to spend a couple of more hours, by foot and by bus, to get back home where she still will have no milk. The officer said she understood the frustration, but told the woman needed to "handle herself in a better way next time." The woman said she knew that. The officer asked what type of milk was she needed, and the young mother said two-percent. With that knowledge, the officer went into the Walmart and purchased two gallons milk with money out of her own pocket. The dairy product would not be transported by foot or by bus, rather in the back of a squad car, as the officer gave the now thankful – and smiling - mother a ride home. She had just experienced community policing, MPD style. Released 02/02/2017 at 10:46 AM by PIO Joel Despain
