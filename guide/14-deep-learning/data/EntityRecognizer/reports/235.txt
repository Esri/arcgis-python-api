It was intended to be a random act of kindness, and the officer who dished it out was seeking no publicity for the good deed. But a second officer, who was with him on a shoplifting call yesterday morning, was so impressed he told his lieutenant, and now the word is out. It happened around 11:00 a.m. The MPD was called to Shopko, 2201 Zeier Rd., where store security had an extremely cooperative retail theft suspect in the office. The remorseful 33-year-old man explained to the arriving officers that he is currently homeless, but there was new hope in his life. He had found a job, but in order to keep it, he had to have a pair of black pants, and that was what he had tried to steal. The officers issued him a citation and walked him outside. That's when one guardian reached into his wallet and gave the man $100, along with some words of encouragement about not giving up.   "Do things for people not because of who they are or what they do in return, but because of who you are" Harold S.
