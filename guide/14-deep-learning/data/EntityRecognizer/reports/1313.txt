 A Vernon Avenue resident reported being kicked and beaten with a baseball bat after several acquaintances broke into his apartment Friday afternoon. The victim said the suspects claimed he stole property from them. They dragged him outside of the building, and continued to batter him. A witness saw what was happening, and yelled for the assault to stop. She called 911 and the suspects drove off in dark colored SUV or truck. MPD detectives are in the process of trying to positively identify the suspects. Released 04/23/2019 at 10:56 AM by PIO Joel Despain
