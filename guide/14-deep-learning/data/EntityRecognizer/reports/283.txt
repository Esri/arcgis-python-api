A woman, driving near Milwaukee St. last evening thought she recognized a car parked on a side street. She took a closer glance and realized it belongs to her father-in-law and she knew it had been stolen on February 28th. As she observed the car, a young man got into it and drove away. She followed at a safe distance while calling the MPD.  The stolen car stopped on Prairie Rose Rd. and the young man started walking away. The MPD was on the scene shortly thereafter and took him into custody. Officers also arrested him on February 9th for driving a different stolen car. In both cases, victims had left their vehicles unlocked and running when they were stolen.  Released 04/04/2019 at 12:33 PM by PIO Joel Despain
