On 3/25/2016, a retired detective of The Madison Police Department noticed a vehicle swerving all over the roadway, near Northport Drive and Dryden Drive.  The 911 Center received the call shortly after 5pm, and the caller noted the driver, later identified as Randall J. Gulvik, operating the vehicle with no hands!  At one point Gulvik was seen scratching his head and back, with his hands, just before crossing the median and sideswiping a pole.  The caller was already concerned, but when Gulvik's vehicle had crossed over into oncoming traffic, police were immediately summoned. Officers arrived, contacted Gulvik, and had immediate concerns about his sobriety, when balanced against the driving behavior he had recently exhibited and was described by the caller.  Officers offered field sobriety tests versus him attempting to continue removing his flat tire (due to striking the curbside), and that resulted in even stronger evidence that his sobriety was in question.  He was taken into custody, and eventually conveyed to the Dane County Jail.   PO Howard Payne Released 03/28/2016 at 10:31 AM by P.O.
