Witnesses said he was the only one near the dance floor who seemed to have no interest in cutting a rug. Instead, he seemed to be messing around in an area where a 63-year-old Madison woman had placed her coat and purse. When she came off the dance floor, she found her purse was gone. About the same time last night, another patron saw the suspect leaving Club 5 on foot. He seemed to be cradling something under an arm. Several, including the victim, were able to provide police with a good description of the suspect, and he was spotted near a convenience store in the 2500 block of Fish Hatchery Rd. Officers found the purse was still tucked under his armpit. He was arrested for theft, and the victim was able to get back her cell phone, credit cards, car keys, and nearly everything else that was in her purse - save for a few dollars.  Released 01/05/2016 at 10:37 AM by PIO Joel Despain
