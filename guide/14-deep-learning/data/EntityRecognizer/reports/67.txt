A couple of people tried, with mixed success, to pass counterfeit $100 bills at East Towne Mall yesterday afternoon. The person listed as #1 above successfully made purchases using a fake $100 bill at Hot Topic. An employee at another store said the person listed as #2 listed above attempted to use a bogus $100 bill at her place of employment. She told an officer – who was on his way to the Hot Topic call - that the bill did not feel like real currency and appeared to be washed and faded. It was rejected. She said her employer has a policy of not contacting police, so she wished to remain anonymous. The two shoppers with the phony money were seen hanging with a third individual: #3 listed above.  Released 01/22/2016 at 10:43 AM by PIO Joel Despain
