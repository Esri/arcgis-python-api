 An employee of a downtown club flagged down a MPD officer last night after a patron pulled a knife on another man inside Paul's Club, 204 State St. The suspect had been escorted outside, and was seated on the sidewalk, singing loudly, as the officer attempted to get him to drop the folding knife, which he still clutched in his hand. The man kept singing, and the officer - once a backup arrived - was able to safely disarm the 66-year-old. He was cited for disorderly conduct while armed. The victim said the knife was pulled when he asked the suspect to back off. He said the suspect - who he does not know - was trying to talk with him, and kept getting very close.   Released 08/31/2018 at 9:30 AM by PIO Joel Despain
