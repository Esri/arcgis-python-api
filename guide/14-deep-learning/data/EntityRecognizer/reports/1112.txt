In recent days, Central District officers have been investigating a rash of smash-and-grab style break-ins where vehicles parked in secure underground parking garages have been targeted. In most cases, a window has been shattered and victims are reporting cash and other items missing. A suspect in many cases is Carlo D. Walkes, age 31, no permanent address. Walkes has been identified through surveillance images and there is probable cause for his arrest. Anyone seeing him should call 911. Those with information on any of these cases can contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014. Burglaries and thefts have been reported in many locations including the 400 block of W. Mifflin St., the 600 block of W. Main St., and the 20 block of N. Butler St. Released 07/24/2018 at 11:58 AM by PIO Joel Despain
