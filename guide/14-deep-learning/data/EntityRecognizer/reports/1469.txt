An estimated 12,000 attended the Mifflin Street Block Party this afternoon: several thousand more than last year. Most celebrants were well-behaved but there was also some dangerous behavior. Several people, standing on balconies, threw beer cans and other items at police and others. Around 65 were cited and released for infractions like drinking on streets and sidewalks, carrying glass containers, and urinating in public. A couple of people went to jail, but there were no serious incidents. A few injuries were reported for things like falling out of a tree and off of a curb.  There was also some minor property damage.  The MPD would like to thank the Madison Fire Department, Dane County Sheriff's Officer, and the Janesville Police Department for assistance in keeping the event as safe as possible.  Released 04/29/2017 at 6:16 PM by PIO Joel Despain
