 The MPD was called to Colony Dr. Sunday afternoon after a citizen saw a group of teenagers entering unlocked cars.  A short time later a similar call, involving the same suspects, came in from Juneau Parkway. An officer spotted a car in the area being operated by one of the suspects. It had been reported stolen out of Fitchburg. The driver, described as a young teenage male, took off after two passengers fled from the car. An officer attempted to pull it over, but terminated for safety reasons when the driver accelerated from the Hill Farms Neighborhood, heading east on Regent St. towards Segoe Rd. Other officers chased down the two passengers: a 13-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy. The driver was identified as also being 13. He has not yet been located. The young criminals appear to be looking for unlocked cars in order to steal items from them, or sometimes take them, if keys are inside. The MPD appreciates residents calling in the suspicious activity, and we continue to urge everyone to lock their vehicles, even if they are near your home on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
